# Cosmic Playground — status

next: port novascope's IMF + cluster census + HR diagram into packages/physics as a new cluster-census demo (survey done 2026-09-04, see docs/reviews/2026-09-04-novascope-port-survey.md); then the star-cluster dynamics demo. Also open: explore's filters are inert in the static build (see below), instructor bundles for eos-lab + stars-zams-hr
blocker: none — /topics/* un-orphaned 2026-09-04 with a route-reachability gate; eos-lab unlisted pending a complete EOS; lint/typecheck/build green, 2,115 unit + 919 e2e passing

## Current focus
_Seeded 2026-06-07 by the brain STATUS.md convention (`~/brain/work/meta/status-convention.md`). Update in your cosmic-playground session; the brain pulls `next:`/`blocker:`/`due:` via `federate.py`._

Research-grade interactive demos (physics unit-tested), deployed live, used in ASTR 101/201. Cottrell EdTech instrument.

## Open
- [ ] (no empirical learning data yet — assessment plan via CRMSE)

## Findings recorded 2026-09-04

- **Explore's filters do nothing in production.** `apps/site` builds with `output: "static"`,
  so `Astro.url.searchParams` is empty at build time and `explore/index.astro` renders one
  unfiltered page. Topic, level, time, status, math, quick-filter, sort and search are all
  computed server-side from params that never arrive; `/explore/?topic=Orbits` returns the
  same 19 cards as `/explore/`. The active-filter chips never render either. `smoke.spec.ts`
  appeared to cover this but only asserted that *some* `.cp-chip` is visible, which the
  quick-filter row always satisfies. Fix is a design decision — client-side filtering, or
  `getStaticPaths` over the filter space, or SSR — so it is not being done incidentally.
  Topic filtering specifically now has a working alternative: `/topics/<slug>/`.
- **`unlisted: true`** is a new demo frontmatter field for "exists, but is not advertised".
  Listing surfaces go through `listedDemos()` in `apps/site/src/lib/catalog.ts`; detail
  routes (`exhibits/`, `stations/`, `instructor/`, `play/`) deliberately still build so
  shared links survive. `eos-lab` is the first user.
