# Backlog

## Next

- Implement “Instrument Standard” runtime features in `packages/runtime` (modes, export results, tour/challenge).
- Expand demo content seeding and improve topic taxonomy.
- Refactor additional demos into `apps/demos/src/demos/<slug>/`.

## Later

- Playwright E2E smoke tests (explore renders; each `/play/<slug>/` loads without console errors).
- Optional `noindex` and nav omission rules for instructor routes (if not already).
- Accessibility audits + keyboard testing checklist per component.
