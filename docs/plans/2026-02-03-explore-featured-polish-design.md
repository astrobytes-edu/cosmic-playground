# Explore Featured Row Polish — Design

**Date:** 2026-02-03  
**Scope:** Explore page only; no behavior changes.

## Goals
- Keep “Start here: Gravity & Orbits” as the curated entry point.
- Add a single lead sentence to guide first-time visitors.
- Improve spacing rhythm around the featured row.

## Microcopy
Heading: **Start here: Gravity & Orbits**  
Lead: **Begin with the core orbit ideas before branching out.**

## Visual Rhythm
- Add a small lead paragraph under the heading.
- Use existing spacing tokens for calm separation.
- Keep featured cards visually identical to standard cards.

## Accessibility
- Heading + paragraph only (no icon-only meaning).
- No hover-only information.

## Verification
- Smoke test to assert the featured lead text appears when featured row is shown.
