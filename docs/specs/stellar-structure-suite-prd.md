# Product Requirements Document: Stellar Structure Demo Suite

**Version:** 1.1
**Author:** Dr. Anna Rosen / Claude
**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Status:** Draft (Revised with Expert Feedback)
**Project:** Cosmic Playground (NSF IUSE Level 2)

---

## Executive Summary

The Stellar Structure Demo Suite is a progressive, 8-demo learning sequence that teaches students how stars work from first principles. Rather than presenting stellar structure as a monolithic set of equations, students "build a star" piece by piece: starting with pressure and gravity, adding energy generation, then energy transport, and finally earning the right to see all four stellar structure equations working together.

**Key principle:** Comprehensive without becoming MESA-in-the-browser.

**Critical architectural decision:** Demos 5–7 require a consistent stellar profile source. Demo 4 (Polytropes) serves as the **shared backbone**—its output provides $T(r)$, $\rho(r)$, $M(r)$ for energy generation, opacity, and transport demos.

## 1. Problem Statement

### The User Problem

Undergraduate astronomy students struggle to understand stellar structure because it's typically taught as four coupled differential equations that must be solved simultaneously. This "all at once" approach obscures the physical intuition: why does pressure balance gravity? What sets the luminosity? Why do some stars have convective cores while others have convective envelopes?

### Who Experiences This Problem

- **Primary:** Undergraduate astronomy majors in stellar astrophysics courses (ASTR 450-level)
- **Secondary:** Graduate students reviewing fundamentals, instructors needing teaching tools
- **Frequency:** Every semester, ~50–100 students per institution taking stellar physics

### Cost of Not Solving

- Students memorize equations without physical understanding
- Instructors resort to static diagrams that can't show parameter dependencies
- No path from "I understand hydrostatic equilibrium" to "I can predict stellar properties"
- Existing tools (MESA, etc.) are too complex for pedagogical exploration

### Evidence

- Course feedback from ASTR 450 (San Diego State University): students cite stellar structure as the hardest conceptual topic
- Similar feedback documented at Princeton, Sydney, Maryland astronomy programs
- No existing interactive suite that builds from first principles to full stellar structure

| Goal | Success Metric |
|------|----------------|
| **G1:** Understand that stellar pressure has multiple components | >80% of students correctly identify which pressure dominates in different stellar regions on post-assessment |
| **G2:** Internalize hydrostatic equilibrium as a balancing act | Students can predict qualitatively what happens when pressure or gravity changes (>75% accuracy) |
| **G3:** Connect energy generation to stellar luminosity | Students can explain why massive stars have centrally concentrated burning |
| **G4:** Understand why convection turns on in certain regions | Students can predict convective vs radiative zones for different stellar masses |
| **G5:** Trace the full path from EOS → HSE → structure → $\varepsilon(\rho,T)$ → $L(r)$ → transport → surface $(L, T_{\rm eff})$ | Capstone completion rate >70% with correct H-R diagram placement |

### Business/Project Goals (What the Grant Gets)

| Goal | Success Metric |
|------|----------------|
| **B1:** Demonstrate NSF IUSE educational innovation | Suite cited in at least 3 peer-reviewed astronomy education papers by Year 3 |
| **B2:** Achieve broad adoption | >20 institutions using suite by end of grant period |
| **B3:** Maintain sustainability | All demos run in pure TypeScript with no server dependencies |

---

## 3. Non-Goals (Explicit Scope Boundaries)

| Non-Goal | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **NG1:** Full MESA-like stellar evolution computed live | 🚫 PUNT — Maintenance nightmare. Use precomputed MIST/PARSEC tracks instead. |
| **NG2:** Full radiative transfer / spectral synthesis | 🚫 PUNT — Wrong tool for the job. Use curated spectra + simplified opacity models. |
| **NG3:** Time-dependent stellar evolution (burning through MS) | Separate demo suite; this focuses on *structure* at a snapshot in time. |
| **NG4:** Binary stellar evolution | Out of scope for Level 2; could be Level 3 extension. |
| **NG5:** Full nuclear network (beyond pp/CNO toy models) | Unnecessary complexity for pedagogical goals. |
| **NG6:** 3D stellar structure | 1D radial profiles are sufficient for teaching fundamentals. |
| **NG7:** Rotation, magnetic fields, mass loss | Advanced topics beyond core stellar structure pedagogy. |

---

## 4. Suite-Wide Design Principles

### 4.1 Layered Complexity Modes (Required for All Demos)

Every demo **must** implement three distinct modes with consistent definitions:

| Mode | Definition | UI Behavior |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Conceptual** | Qualitative relationships, cartoons, normalized/dimensionless plots, minimal equations (hover-to-reveal). Focus on "what happens when I change X?" | Hide equations by default; show only ratios and trends |
| **Quantitative** | Real units (cgs), compute actual values, show governing equations, allow CSV/JSON exports. Focus on "what are the numbers?" | Display equations prominently; show unit-ful values |
| **Advanced** | Extra physics (degeneracy, OPAL tables, partial ionization), stability notes, diagnostics, and caveats about approximations | Unlock additional parameters; show validation diagnostics |

### 4.2 Shared Star Profile Source (`StarProfileSource`)

Demos 5–7 require $T(r)$, $\rho(r)$, $M(r)$ profiles to compute $\varepsilon$, $\kappa$, and $\nabla_{\rm rad}$. These profiles come from a **shared source**:

- **v1 (Required):** Use Demo 4 Polytrope output as the backbone
- **v2 (Future):** Use Demo 8 Capstone solver output when available

**UI Integration:** Students see one coherent "star skeleton" reused across Demos 5–7. Changing the polytrope in Demo 4 propagates to dependent demos.

```typescript
interface StarProfileSource {
  readonly r: Float64Array;      // radial coordinate [cm]
  readonly rho: Float64Array;    // density [g/cm³]
  readonly T: Float64Array;      // temperature [K]
  readonly M_r: Float64Array;    // enclosed mass [g]
  readonly P: Float64Array;      // pressure [dyn/cm²]
  readonly sourceDemo: 'polytrope' | 'capstone';
}
```

### 4.3 Physics Sanity Invariants (Enforced Suite-Wide)

All solvers must enforce and report:

| Invariant | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| $M(r)$ strictly increasing | Halt + diagnostic if violated |
| $P, \rho, T \geq 0$ | Clamp to floor + warning indicator |
| $L(r)$ non-decreasing for $\varepsilon > 0$ | Diagnostic if violated |
| Graceful stop conditions | "Photosphere reached," "pressure floor hit," "integration diverged" |

### 4.4 Predict–Play–Explain Pedagogy (P1)

For NSF IUSE alignment, each demo should include:

1. **Predict:** 1–2 prediction questions before interaction ("What do you think will happen if you increase the mass?")
2. **Play:** Interactive exploration
3. **Explain:** 1 reflection prompt after ("Was your prediction correct? Why or why not?")
4. **Check:** Optional "check your understanding" concept question

## 5. User Stories (Demo-by-Demo)

### Demo 1: Equation of State Lab

> **As a** stellar astrophysics student,
> **I want to** adjust temperature, density, and mean molecular weight and see how gas pressure vs radiation pressure change,
> **so that** I understand why massive stars care about radiation pressure and can predict which pressure dominates in different stellar environments.

**Physics Notes:**
- Display the **gas fraction** $\beta = P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm tot}$, NOT an "Eddington limit warning" (that's a different concept)
- If showing an Eddington-related diagnostic, compute and display the **Eddington parameter**:
  $$\Gamma = \frac{\kappa L}{4\pi c G M}$$
  and explain that $\Gamma \to 1$ means radiation pressure approaches the gravitational binding

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Log sliders** for $T$ ($10^3$–$10^8$ K) and $\rho$ ($10^{-8}$–$10^6$ g/cm³)
- [ ] Separate $\mu$ (mean molecular weight per particle) for ideal gas; add $\mu_e$ (per electron) for degeneracy (P2)
- [ ] **Regime map visualization:** Point on $\log \rho$–$\log T$ diagram with shaded regions for core/envelope/atmosphere of canonical stars (Sun, massive MS, RG, WD)
- [ ] Display $P_{\rm rad}/P_{\rm gas}$ on log scale (not just pie chart—dynamic range is huge)
- [ ] Optional pie chart for $\beta$ when values are comparable
- [ ] Degeneracy pressure toggle for Advanced mode (shows when $P_{\rm deg}$ becomes relevant)

### Demo 2: Hydrostatic Equilibrium

> **As a** student learning the stellar structure equations,
> **I want to** choose a density profile and watch the pressure profile get computed via hydrostatic equilibrium,
> **so that** I understand that $\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{\rho G M(r)}{r^2}$ is a balancing act between pressure and gravity.

**Physics Notes:**
- Make the workflow explicit: (1) choose $\rho(r)$, (2) compute $M(r)$ from mass continuity, (3) integrate $P(r)$ from HSE
- Boundary condition choice matters pedagogically:
  - **Option A:** Fix $P_c$ and integrate outward → star may not have $P(R)=0$ nicely
  - **Option B:** Enforce $P(R)=0$ and integrate inward (more BVP-ish)
- The "collapse/expand" animation is **conceptual stability intuition**, not a real dynamical simulation—label it as such

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Preset density profiles: uniform, linear, power-law, polytropic (from Demo 4)
- [ ] Displays both equations: $\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{\rho G M(r)}{r^2}$ and $\frac{dM}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho$
- [ ] Real-time integration as parameters change
- [ ] Animation showing "if pressure is too low → collapse; too high → expand" (labeled as conceptual)
- [ ] Boundary condition selector (Quantitative/Advanced modes)
- [ ] Export $P(r)$, $M(r)$, $\rho(r)$ profiles as CSV

### Demo 3: Timescales & Virial Theorem

> **As a** student confused about why stars don't instantly collapse or explode,
> **I want to** see the three fundamental timescales (dynamical, thermal, nuclear) for a given star,
> **so that** I understand what "equilibrium" means and why stars are stable most of the time.

**Physics Notes:**
- Show formulas (toggleable in Quantitative mode):
  - $t_{\rm dyn} \sim \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{G M}}$ (free-fall / sound crossing)
  - $t_{\rm KH} \sim \frac{G M^2}{R L}$ (Kelvin-Helmholtz / thermal)
  - $t_{\rm nuc} \sim \frac{\eta M c^2}{L}$ (nuclear, with efficiency factor $\eta \sim 0.007$)
- For virial, be explicit it's idealized: "roughly $2K + U \approx 0$" for a stable, self-gravitating gas sphere

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Inputs: $M$, $R$, $L$ (with presets for Sun, red giant, white dwarf, massive star)
- [ ] Computes and displays: $t_{\rm dyn}$, $t_{\rm KH}$, $t_{\rm nuc}$ with formulas shown
- [ ] Bar chart comparing timescales on log scale
- [ ] Explanation of what each timescale means physically
- [ ] Virial theorem visualization: $2K + U = 0$, what happens when perturbed (conceptual)

### Demo 4: Polytrope Playground (Lane-Emden)

> **As a** student learning stellar structure,
> **I want to** adjust the polytropic index $n$ and see how the entire star's structure changes,
> **so that** I understand how a single parameter controls density concentration, mass-radius relations, and whether a star is convective or radiative.

**Physics Notes:**
- This is the **"mathematical microscope"** of the suite and serves as the shared profile backbone
- Add explicit "dimensionless → physical scaling" panel:
  - $\xi$, $\theta(\xi)$ are dimensionless
  - Show how choosing $K$ and $\rho_c$ sets $R$ and $M$
- For $n \to 5$: be clear it has infinite radius; show "truncation radius" as user-controlled cutoff

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Slider for polytropic index $n$ (0 to 5, with special markers at 1.5, 3, 4.5)
- [ ] Real-time Lane-Emden integration: $\frac{d^2\theta}{d\xi^2} + \frac{2}{\xi}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi} + \theta^n = 0$
- [ ] Boundary conditions: $\theta(0) = 1$, $\theta'(0) = 0$
- [ ] Plots: $\rho(r)/\rho_c$, $P(r)/P_c$, $M(r)/M_{\rm total}$ vs $r/R$
- [ ] Display central concentration $\rho_c/\langle\rho\rangle$
- [ ] **Dimensionless → physical scaling panel** (Quantitative mode)
- [ ] Mass-radius scaling relation for selected $n$
- [ ] Annotations: $n=1.5$ (fully convective), $n=3$ (Eddington standard model), $n \to 5$ (infinite extent with truncation)
- [ ] **Export as `StarProfileSource`** for Demos 5–7

### Demo 5: Energy Generation Sandbox

> **As a** student learning about nuclear burning in stars,
> **I want to** compare how different energy generation laws $\varepsilon(\rho, T)$ affect where luminosity is produced,
> **so that** I understand why massive stars have centrally concentrated burning (CNO) while low-mass stars have more distributed burning (pp-chain).

**Physics Notes:**
- **Requires `StarProfileSource`** from Demo 4 (or Demo 8) to provide $T(r)$, $\rho(r)$
- Energy generation laws need normalization:
  - Default: show normalized $dL/dr$ and $L(r)/L_{\rm tot}$ only (simplest)
  - Advanced: include calibration constant so "Sun preset" produces $\sim L_\odot$

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Loads profile from Demo 4** (or presets if Demo 4 not completed)
- [ ] Toggle between pp-like ($\varepsilon \propto \rho T^4$) and CNO-like ($\varepsilon \propto \rho T^{16-20}$)
- [ ] Custom mode: adjustable exponents $\varepsilon \propto \rho T^n$
- [ ] Plot $\frac{dL}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho \varepsilon$ showing where luminosity is generated
- [ ] Cumulative $L(r)/L_{\rm tot}$ showing energy generation distribution
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison of low-mass vs high-mass profiles

### Demo 6: Opacity & Photon Diffusion

> **As a** student learning about radiative transport,
> **I want to** see how opacity varies with temperature and density and understand the "random walk" of photons,
> **so that** I can predict when radiative transport is efficient vs inefficient.

**Physics Notes:**
- **Opacity regime map in $\log \rho$–$\log T$ space is the killer feature**
- Show scaling relationships:
  - Electron scattering: $\kappa_{\rm es} \approx 0.2(1+X)$ cm²/g (approximately constant)
  - Kramers (bound-free + free-free): $\kappa_{\rm Kr} \propto \rho T^{-3.5}$
  - H⁻ opacity: important in cool stellar atmospheres
- Random walk diagnostics: mean free path $\lambda$, optical depth $\tau$, diffusion time scaling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Loads profile from Demo 4** for computing $\kappa(r)$ along the star
- [ ] **Opacity regime map** in $\log \rho$–$\log T$ space with labeled regions
- [ ] Opacity regimes visualization: electron scattering ($\kappa \approx \text{const}$), Kramers ($\kappa \propto \rho T^{-3.5}$), H⁻ opacity
- [ ] Mean free path calculator: $\lambda = \frac{1}{\kappa \rho}$
- [ ] Optical depth visualization: $\tau = \int \kappa \rho \, dr$ from surface
- [ ] Random walk animation showing photon diffusion time scaling
- [ ] Advanced mode: load OPAL Rosseland mean opacity table as precomputed dataset (default uses analytic fits)

### Demo 7: Transport Regimes (Radiative vs Convective)

> **As a** student learning about energy transport,
> **I want to** see when convection turns on by comparing the radiative gradient to the adiabatic gradient,
> **so that** I can predict convective zone boundaries for different stellar types.

**Physics Notes:**
- **Requires `StarProfileSource`** to compute $\nabla_{\rm rad}$ along a profile (not in isolation)
- Schwarzschild criterion: convection when $\nabla_{\rm rad} > \nabla_{\rm ad}$
- Add **Kippenhahn-style 1D bar** (radius axis, colored regions)—instantly interpretable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Loads profile from Demo 4** (or presets)
- [ ] Displays $\nabla_{\rm rad}$ (radiative gradient) vs $\nabla_{\rm ad}$ (adiabatic gradient) along profile
- [ ] Schwarzschild criterion visualization: convection when $\nabla_{\rm rad} > \nabla_{\rm ad}$
- [ ] Adjustable parameters: opacity multiplier, luminosity, composition
- [ ] Presets showing canonical patterns:
  - Solar-type: convective envelope, radiative core
  - Massive MS: convective core, radiative envelope
- [ ] **Kippenhahn-style 1D bar** showing convective vs radiative zones along radius
- [ ] Cartoon cross-section showing convective vs radiative zones

### Demo 8: Capstone — Solve a Toy Star

> **As a** student who has mastered the building blocks,
> **I want to** solve all four stellar structure equations together for a simplified star,
> **so that** I can see how mass continuity, HSE, energy generation, and energy transport combine to determine a star's structure and place on the H-R diagram.

**⚠️ Boss Fight Risk:** This is where numerical methods, boundary conditions, and "why is everything NaN" meet in a dark alley. Requires tighter scoping and deliberate numerical formulation.

#### Two-Layers-of-Truth Contract

| Layer | Behavior | When Active |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Layer 1 (Robust)** | Simplified solver that **never catastrophically fails**. May be approximate, but always produces a physically reasonable result. Uses constrained parameter space. | Always on (default) |
| **Layer 2 (Advanced)** | More realistic solver that **can fail gracefully** and shows diagnostics when it does. Unlocks wider parameter space. | Advanced mode toggle |

#### Numerical Formulation (v1 Recommendation)

**Use mass coordinate $m$ instead of radius $r$ as the independent variable.** This avoids center singularities and is the standard stellar structure choice:

$$\frac{dr}{dm} = \frac{1}{4\pi r^2 \rho}, \quad \frac{dP}{dm} = -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^4}, \quad \frac{dL}{dm} = \varepsilon, \quad \frac{dT}{dm} = -\frac{GmT}{4\pi r^4 P}\nabla$$

**Physics constraints for v1:**
- **EOS:** Ideal gas + radiation pressure; degeneracy deferred to P2
- **Opacity:** Electron scattering + Kramers fit; optional H⁻ fit
- **Energy generation:** pp-like vs CNO-like with tunable exponent
- **Convection:** Schwarzschild criterion with $\nabla_{\rm ad}$ fixed; variable $\nabla_{\rm ad}$ in Advanced

**Numerical method:**
- **v1:** Shooting method (fast, teachable) with strong diagnostics + fallback constraints
- **Future (P2):** Relaxation method (Henyey-lite) for robustness

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Inputs: total mass $M$, composition $(X, Y, Z)$, simplified physics choices
- [ ] **Uses mass coordinate $m$** as independent variable (not $r$)
- [ ] Solves coupled ODEs: $dr/dm$, $dP/dm$, $dL/dm$, $dT/dm$
- [ ] Outputs: radial profiles of $\rho(r)$, $P(r)$, $T(r)$, $L(r)$, $M(r)$
- [ ] Places resulting star on H-R diagram ($L$ vs $T_{\rm eff}$)
- [ ] **Layer 1:** Always produces result within guardrailed parameter space
- [ ] **Layer 2 (Advanced):** Wider parameter range with graceful failure + diagnostics
- [ ] Compare to MIST/PARSEC for validation (order-of-magnitude correct; calibrated to hit Sun reasonably)
- [ ] Export all profiles and H-R position as JSON

### Edge Cases & Error States

> **As a** student who enters unphysical parameters,
> **I want to** see a clear explanation of why my star "doesn't work,"
> **so that** I learn the physical constraints on stellar structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Graceful handling of: negative pressures, super-Eddington luminosity, unphysical density inversions
- [ ] Error messages explain physics: "This configuration exceeds the Eddington limit ($\Gamma > 1$)—the star would be blown apart by radiation pressure"
- [ ] "Reset to physical" button with suggested parameters
- [ ] Integration failure recovery with diagnostic output
- [ ] Physics sanity invariants displayed as health indicators

## 9. Open Questions

### Blocking (Must resolve before implementation)

| Question | Owner | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Q1:** What opacity fits for default mode? | Physics | Kramers + electron scattering; need coefficients |

## 11. Timeline & Phasing

### Recommended Build Order

Based on the principle that **Demo 4 is the backbone** and Demos 2, 4, 6, 8 form the "minimum complete suite":

| Phase | Demos | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 0** | `StarProfileSource` contract | 0.5 weeks | Interface + mock data |
| **Phase 1** | Demo 4 (Polytropes) | 2 weeks | Lane-Emden solver + visualization + profile export |
| **Phase 2** | Demo 2 (HSE) | 1.5 weeks | HSE integrator + collapse/expand animation |
| **Phase 3** | Demo 6 (Opacity) | 1.5 weeks | Opacity models + random walk viz + profile loading |
| **Phase 4** | Demo 8 (Capstone) | 3 weeks | Full 4-equation solver (mass coord) + H-R placement + two-layer robustness |
| **Phase 5** | Demos 1, 3, 5, 7 | 3 weeks | Complete suite + polish |
| **Phase 6** | Validation + Docs | 1 week | Test suite + instructor materials |

**Total:** ~12.5 weeks for full suite

### Milestones

| Milestone | Date | Criteria |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **M0: Profile Contract** | +0.5 weeks | `StarProfileSource` interface defined and tested with mock |
| **M1: Core Physics** | +4 weeks | Demos 2, 4 working with tests; profile propagation functional |
| **M2: Transport** | +6 weeks | Demo 6 complete; opacity infrastructure; profile loading verified |
| **M3: Capstone Alpha** | +9 weeks | Demo 8 producing H-R placement; Layer 1 robust |
| **M4: Full Suite Beta** | +11.5 weeks | All 8 demos; internal testing; WebWorker execution |
| **M5: v1.0 Release** | +12.5 weeks | Validated, documented, deployed |

## 14. Appendix: Physics Reference

### The Four Stellar Structure Equations

In mass coordinate $m$:

1. **Radius:** $\frac{dr}{dm} = \frac{1}{4\pi r^2 \rho}$

2. **Hydrostatic Equilibrium:** $\frac{dP}{dm} = -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^4}$

3. **Luminosity:** $\frac{dL}{dm} = \varepsilon$

4. **Temperature:** $\frac{dT}{dm} = -\frac{Gm T}{4\pi r^4 P} \nabla$

where $\nabla = \nabla_{\rm rad}$ (radiative) or $\nabla_{\rm ad}$ (convective).

### Radiative and Adiabatic Gradients

$$\nabla_{\rm rad} = \frac{3\kappa L P}{16\pi a c G m T^4}$$

$$\nabla_{\rm ad} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma} \approx 0.4 \text{ (ideal monatomic gas)}$$

**Schwarzschild criterion:** Convection occurs when $\nabla_{\rm rad} > \nabla_{\rm ad}$

### Lane-Emden Equation

For polytropic EOS $P = K\rho^{1+1/n}$:

$$\frac{d^2\theta}{d\xi^2} + \frac{2}{\xi}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi} + \theta^n = 0$$

With boundary conditions: $\theta(0) = 1$, $\theta'(0) = 0$

**Dimensionless variables:**
- $\xi = r/\alpha$ where $\alpha^2 = \frac{(n+1)K\rho_c^{(1-n)/n}}{4\pi G}$
- $\theta^n = \rho/\rho_c$

### Eddington Parameter

$$\Gamma = \frac{\kappa L}{4\pi c G M}$$

When $\Gamma \to 1$, radiation pressure approaches gravitational binding and the star becomes unstable.

**Note:** This is distinct from the gas fraction $\beta = P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm tot}$.

### Key Timescales

$$t_{\rm dyn} \sim \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{GM}} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{G\bar{\rho}}}$$

$$t_{\rm KH} \sim \frac{GM^2}{RL}$$

$$t_{\rm nuc} \sim \frac{\eta M c^2}{L} \quad (\eta \approx 0.007 \text{ for H burning})$$

### Key Physical Constants

| Constant | Symbol | Value | Units |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Gravitational constant | $G$ | $6.674 \times 10^{-8}$ | cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻² |
| Radiation constant | $a$ | $7.566 \times 10^{-15}$ | erg cm⁻³ K⁻⁴ |
| Speed of light | $c$ | $2.998 \times 10^{10}$ | cm s⁻¹ |
| Boltzmann constant | $k$ | $1.381 \times 10^{-16}$ | erg K⁻¹ |
| Hydrogen mass | $m_{\rm H}$ | $1.673 \times 10^{-24}$ | g |
| Solar mass | $M_\odot$ | $1.989 \times 10^{33}$ | g |
| Solar radius | $R_\odot$ | $6.957 \times 10^{10}$ | cm |
| Solar luminosity | $L_\odot$ | $3.828 \times 10^{33}$ | erg s⁻¹ |
| Solar effective temperature | $T_{\rm eff,\odot}$ | $5772$ | K |
