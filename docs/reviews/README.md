# Demo Reviews

Per-demo competitive analysis, pedagogical assessment, and quality verification reports.

Each review documents:
- **Feature comparison** with existing tools in the field
- **Novel contributions** unique to this implementation
- **Pedagogical design** (scaffolding, challenges, data collection)
- **Scientific correctness** verification results
- **Architecture and test coverage** metrics
- **Known limitations** and improvement opportunities
- **Grant-relevant metrics** for NSF IUSE and similar proposals
