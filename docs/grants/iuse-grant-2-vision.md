## Executive Summary

This document outlines a vision for a second NSF IUSE grant that would develop **advanced interactive demo suites** for teaching model-based reasoning in astrophysics. While Grant 1 establishes foundational demos for ASTR 101/201, Grant 2 would create comprehensive, research-validated demo ecosystems for **stellar structure**, **galaxies**, and **cosmology**—along with a rigorous study of how interactive simulations can help students overcome math anxiety and develop genuine equation fluency.

**The Core Research Question:** Can structured interaction with physics models help students move from "math avoidance" to "equation ownership"—and can we measure this transformation?

---

## The Problem This Grant Addresses

### The Neglected Middle: Why Intermediate Courses Are Understudied

**Here's the gap:** The vast majority of STEM education research focuses on two endpoints:

1. **Intro/GE courses** (Astro 101, Physics for Poets, etc.) — High enrollment, high impact on general scientific literacy, lots of NSF attention
2. **Upper-division/graduate courses** — Small enrollment, assumed to be "self-filtering" for motivated students

**What's missing:** The intermediate courses (200-level) that determine whether students *become* STEM majors.

| Course Level | NSF/Research Attention | Why |
|--------------|------------------------|-----|
| Intro/GE (101) | **High** | Large N, gen-ed requirements, scientific literacy |
| Intermediate (201) | **Low** | Smaller N, "just prereqs," assumed students will figure it out |
| Upper-div (300+) | **Moderate** | Research pipelines, capstone experiences |

**The irony:** 201-level courses are where students decide if they *can* do physics. This is where math anxiety hits hardest—where the "conceptual" intro course suddenly demands equations. Students who loved Astro 101 hit a wall in Astro 201 and leave the major.

**This is novel because:**
- Most interactive simulation research (PhET, etc.) targets intro courses
- Most "studio physics" implementations are for Physics 101/102
- Almost no rigorous research exists on simulation-based learning in intermediate astrophysics
- The equation fluency question is essentially unstudied at this level

**Why NSF should care:** If we only improve intro courses, we're improving scientific literacy—valuable, but not producing scientists. Improving intermediate courses directly impacts the STEM workforce pipeline.

---

### The Math Anxiety Crisis in STEM

Math anxiety affects 25-80% of college students (Beilock & Maloney, 2015), and it's particularly acute in physics and astronomy where equations are central. The traditional response has been either:

1. **Avoidance:** Remove equations, teach conceptually only → Students can't do upper-division work
2. **Persistence:** Keep teaching the same way → High DFW rates, students drop STEM

Neither works. We need a third path.

### The Hypothesis

**Interactive simulations with structured scaffolding can serve as a "bridge" between conceptual understanding and equation fluency.** When students:

1. See an equation's behavior before memorizing its form
2. Predict what changing a term will do
3. Test that prediction in a simulation
4. Explain the result in their own words

...they develop a fundamentally different relationship with equations. The equation becomes a *tool for understanding*, not a *barrier to understanding*.

### Why This Matters Now

- Grant 1 will establish that interactive demos improve learning in intro courses
- But the hard question remains: **Does this transfer to equation fluency?**
- Upper-division courses still require mathematical sophistication
- If demos only work for conceptual learning, we've just delayed the problem

Grant 2 would test whether the approach scales to equation-heavy content.

---

## Why This Matters in an AI-Driven World

### The Coming Skill Shift

**The blunt truth:** ChatGPT can already solve most undergraduate physics problems. Within 5 years, AI will handle routine quantitative tasks that currently define "STEM competence."

This changes what we need to teach.

| Skill | Pre-AI Value | Post-AI Value |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Solving textbook problems | High | Near zero (AI does it faster) |
| Memorizing equations | Moderate | Zero (AI has perfect recall) |
| Recognizing when an answer is physically absurd | Moderate | **Critical** (AI can't do this reliably) |
| Building mental models of physical systems | Moderate | **Critical** (foundation for AI oversight) |
| Knowing which model applies to which situation | Moderate | **Critical** (requires domain intuition) |
| Evaluating whether a model's assumptions are met | Low (rarely tested) | **Critical** (AI doesn't know what it doesn't know) |

**The new core competency:** Not solving equations, but *knowing whether the solution makes sense.*

### Physical Intuition as AI-Resistant Skill

Autor (2015) and Brynjolfsson & McAfee (2014) argue that automation complements—rather than replaces—workers who can exercise judgment in novel situations. The skills that remain valuable are precisely those that require:

1. **Causal understanding** of physical systems (not just pattern matching)
2. **Anomaly detection** (recognizing when outputs violate physical constraints)
3. **Model selection** (knowing which approximation applies where)
4. **Uncertainty quantification** (knowing what you don't know)

These are exactly the skills that demo-based learning with Equation Maps develops. Students who learn to predict what an equation will do—and explain why—are building the intuition that AI lacks.

### Reframing the Proposal

This grant isn't just about teaching astronomy better. It's about **developing pedagogies for AI-resistant STEM competencies.**

The demos become training environments for:
- Detecting when a model is being misapplied
- Recognizing physically absurd outputs
- Understanding what assumptions underlie each equation
- Explaining *why* an equation works, not just *that* it works

**The pitch to NSF:** We're not preparing students for the STEM workforce of 2010. We're preparing them for the STEM workforce of 2035, where their value lies in what AI can't do: physical judgment.

## Addressing the Small N Problem

### The Objection

NSF reviewers may ask: "Intro courses have 300+ students. Intermediate courses have 30-50. Why fund research on a smaller population?"

### The Counter-Arguments

#### 1. Pipeline Leverage: Small N, High Impact

Not all students are equal in terms of STEM workforce impact.

| Course | Typical N | Conversion to Major | STEM Workforce Contribution |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Astro 101 (GE) | 300 | ~5% (15 students) | Low (most forget everything) |
| Astro 201 (majors) | 40 | ~80% (32 students) | High (these become scientists) |

**The math:** Improving 201 by 20% retention = 6-8 additional scientists. Improving 101 by 20% engagement = maybe 1-2 additional majors.

**The leverage is at 201, not 101.**

PCAST (2012) estimated that the US needs 1 million additional STEM graduates over a decade. The bottleneck isn't interest (plenty of students start STEM)—it's persistence through the "hard" courses. Intermediate courses are the filter.

#### 2. Multi-Cohort Accumulation

Over a 3-year grant:
- Year 1: 40-50 students (pilot)
- Year 2: 50-60 students (full implementation)
- Year 3: 50-60 students (replication + longitudinal)

**Total N = 140-170 students** — sufficient for detecting medium effect sizes (d = 0.5) with adequate power.

#### 3. Multi-Institution Partnership

To increase N and test generalizability:

| Institution | Type | Est. 201 Enrollment | 3-Year N |
|-------------|------|---------------------|----------|
| SDSU | R2 public | 40-50/year | 120-150 |
| Partner 1 (TBD) | R1 or SLAC | 30-60/year | 90-180 |
| Partner 2 (TBD) | Community college pathway | 20-40/year | 60-120 |

**Combined N = 270-450 students** across diverse institutional contexts.

This also addresses generalizability: if the intervention works at an R2, an R1, and a CC, the results are more convincing than single-institution findings.

#### 4. Cost-Per-Scientist Efficiency

| Intervention | Typical Cost | Target N | Est. Additional STEM Graduates | Cost per Graduate |
|--------------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Intro course reform | $500K | 1,000 | ~20 (2% conversion improvement) | $25,000 |
| Intermediate course reform | $400K | 150 | ~15-20 (10-15% retention improvement) | $20,000-27,000 |

**The efficiency is comparable**—and intermediate course reform has the added benefit of producing graduates with deeper preparation.

## Transferability: Beyond Astronomy

### Why Astronomy Is a Good Testbed

Astronomy occupies a unique pedagogical niche:

| Feature | Astronomy | Physics | Engineering |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Equations are real | ✓ (same as physics) | ✓ | ✓ (applied) |
| Math anxiety barrier | Moderate | High | High |
| Visual/intuitive hooks | **High** (pictures of space) | Moderate | Variable |
| Student interest | **High** (everyone loves space) | Moderate | Variable |
| Cultural baggage ("hard") | Moderate | **High** | **High** |

Astronomy is "physics with better PR." Students who are intimidated by "physics" will take astronomy. This makes astronomy an ideal testbed for pedagogies that help students engage with equations—because students show up with interest rather than dread.

### Transferable Pedagogical Innovations

The techniques developed in this grant are not astronomy-specific:

| Innovation | Astronomy Application | Transfer Potential |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Equation Maps** | Hydrostatic equilibrium, Friedmann equation | Any equation-heavy course (thermodynamics, circuits, mechanics) |
| **Predict-Explore-Explain** | Demo missions with predictions | Any simulation-based instruction |
| **Model Cards** | "What the star model assumes" | Any computational model in any field |
| **Failure Analysis** | "I broke the polytrope by..." | Engineering design, computational science |
| **Synthesis Memos** | "My star is [type] because..." | Scientific writing in any discipline |

### The Broader Vision

If this grant succeeds, it provides:

1. **Proof of concept** that equation fluency can be taught through simulations
2. **Validated instruments** (Equation Fluency Inventory) usable in any STEM field
3. **Pedagogical framework** (Predict-Explore-Explain + Equation Maps) adaptable to physics, chemistry, engineering
4. **Open-source demonstration** that other disciplines can fork and adapt

**The pitch:** We're using astronomy as a testbed to develop STEM-wide pedagogical innovations. The demos are astronomy-specific, but the *approach* is universal.

## Research Goals

### Primary Research Questions

1. **Math Anxiety Reduction:** Does structured demo-based learning reduce math anxiety as measured by validated instruments (MARS-R, Fennema-Sherman)?

2. **Equation Fluency Development:** Do students who learn through demos develop better "equation sense"—the ability to:
   - Predict what an equation will produce before calculating
   - Identify which terms dominate in different regimes
   - Diagnose when an equation is being misapplied
   - Transfer equation understanding to new contexts

3. **Transfer to Upper-Division:** Do students from demo-based courses perform better in traditional upper-division courses that require mathematical derivation?

4. **Mechanism Identification:** What specific features of demo-based learning drive improvements? Is it:
   - Visualization of abstract relationships?
   - Immediate feedback on predictions?
   - Low-stakes exploration before high-stakes assessment?
   - Writing-to-learn through Equation Maps?

### Secondary Research Questions

5. **Instructor Adoption:** What support do instructors need to implement demo-based teaching effectively?

6. **Equity Effects:** Does demo-based learning differentially benefit students from groups traditionally underrepresented in physics/astronomy?

7. **Optimal Scaffolding:** How much guidance is optimal? How does this change as students gain expertise?

### Why Equity Matters Here

Math anxiety is not evenly distributed. Research shows:

- **Women report higher math anxiety** than men, even at equal performance levels (Hembree, 1990; Else-Quest et al., 2010)
- **First-generation college students** often lack the "hidden curriculum" knowledge that helps navigate math-heavy courses
- **Students from under-resourced high schools** may have gaps that manifest as "anxiety" rather than ability deficits
- **Stereotype threat** can amplify math anxiety in testing situations (Spencer et al., 1999)

**The hypothesis:** If demo-based learning reduces math anxiety and builds equation confidence through low-stakes exploration (rather than high-stakes exams), it may disproportionately benefit students who currently leave STEM due to anxiety rather than ability.

**This is testable.** We can disaggregate outcomes by demographic group and examine whether the intervention closes gaps or maintains them.

# PART II: THE RESEARCH DESIGN

---

## Theoretical Framework

### Why Theory Matters

NSF reviewers ask: **"What's your theory of change?"** — meaning, *why* do you think this intervention will work?

Without a clear theoretical framework, a proposal looks like "we believe demos are good, so let's use demos." Theory serves three purposes:

1. **Guides research questions** — what to measure, what mechanisms to look for
2. **Explains design choices** — why prediction mode? why Equation Maps? why low-stakes exploration?
3. **Makes findings generalizable** — if the theory is right, the approach should work in other contexts

We adopt a **three-layer theoretical model**:

| Layer | Framework | Role | What It Explains |
|-------|-----------|------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | Grounded Cognition | The substrate | Why equations + visualization together create meaning |
| **Mechanism** | Productive Failure | The learning driver | Why predictions + feedback produce deep learning |
| **Pathway** | Self-Efficacy | The affective channel | Why low-stakes exploration reduces anxiety and builds persistence |

**Critical design principle:** Equations are presented WITH the demos from the start — not introduced afterward. Students see the equation while they explore, creating real-time perceptual-symbolic binding.

---

### Foundational Framework: Grounded Cognition

**Source:** Barsalou, L. W. (2008); Goldstone & Son (2005); Nathan (2012)

**The Core Idea:** Abstract concepts are understood through perceptual and motor simulations. We don't understand "gravity" as a symbol — we understand it through felt experiences of falling, pulling, weight. Learning is better when abstract ideas are *grounded* in perceptual experience.

**Why This Is Foundational (Not Supporting):**

In our design, equations are **visible during exploration**, not revealed afterward. This means grounded cognition isn't just "helpful" — it's the *mechanism* by which equations become meaningful:

```

│   = Perceptual-symbolic binding in real-time                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Mechanism:**
1. Equation is visible from the start (not hidden, not "earned")
2. Student manipulates a parameter via slider
3. Visualization changes AND equation terms highlight simultaneously
4. The symbol becomes a *label* for a perceptual experience
5. Repeated across many parameters → robust mental model of the equation

**How It Applies to Our Demos:**

| Demo Feature | Grounded Cognition Mechanism |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Equation always visible** | No "symbol shock" — equation is normalized from start |
| **Term-by-term highlighting** | Direct perceptual link between symbol and effect |
| **Parameter sliders** | Embodied interaction → feeling how quantities relate |
| **Side-by-side equation + viz** | Continuous binding, not sequential |

**Key Insight:** Students who "see" what $P \propto M^2/R^4$ does while manipulating it don't just *learn* the equation — they develop an intuition that makes the equation *preferable* to words. The equation becomes a concise summary of something they now understand deeply.

**Strengths:**
- Explains why equations WITH visualization beats visualization THEN equation
- Strong cognitive science foundation
- Predicts that equation fluency requires perceptual grounding, not just practice

---

### Learning Mechanism: Productive Failure

**Source:** Kapur, M. (2008, 2014, 2016)

**The Core Idea:** Learning is deeper when students first *struggle* with a problem before receiving instruction. The struggle activates prior knowledge, reveals gaps, and creates a "need to know" that makes subsequent instruction meaningful.

**The Mechanism:**
1. Students attempt a task they can't fully solve
2. They generate multiple (often incorrect) representations and predictions
3. The gap between expectation and reality creates cognitive dissonance
4. Instruction/feedback follows, which now "sticks" because students know *why* they need it
5. Consolidation activities (writing, explanation) solidify understanding

**How It Applies to Our Demos:**

| Demo Feature | Productive Failure Mechanism |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Prediction Mode** | Students commit to a prediction before seeing the result → generation of (often incorrect) expectations |
| **Simulation Run** | Immediate feedback reveals discrepancy → productive failure moment |
| **"Explain the discrepancy"** | Consolidation phase → making sense of why prediction was wrong |
| **Equation Maps** | Structured consolidation → connecting perceptual experience to symbolic representation |

**Key Predictions (Testable):**
- Students who make more *wrong* predictions (and resolve them) should show greater learning gains
- The predict → observe → explain cycle should produce better retention than observe-only
- Struggling with a demo before Equation Maps should produce better maps than Equation Maps alone

**Key Citations:**

- Kapur, M., & Bielaczyc, K. (2012). Designing for productive failure. *Journal of the Learning Sciences*, 21(1), 45-83.

**Strengths:**
- Well-validated in math and science education
- Clear predictions that guide measurement
- Aligns perfectly with our predict-explore-explain cycle
- Explains *why* active exploration beats passive observation

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't directly address math anxiety (cognitive, not affective)
- Requires careful scaffolding — too much failure can be demotivating

---

### Affective Pathway: Self-Efficacy Theory

**Source:** Bandura, A. (1977, 1997)

**The Core Idea:** People's beliefs about their ability to succeed (self-efficacy) determine whether they persist or give up. Self-efficacy is built through four sources:

1. **Mastery experiences** — successfully accomplishing tasks
2. **Vicarious experience** — seeing similar others succeed
3. **Verbal persuasion** — encouragement from credible sources
4. **Physiological states** — interpreting anxiety as excitement vs. threat

**The Vicious Cycle of Math Anxiety:**
```
Low self-efficacy → Avoidance → Less practice → Lower performance → Confirms low self-efficacy
```

**How It Applies to Our Demos:**

| Demo Feature | Self-Efficacy Mechanism |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **Low-stakes exploration** | Removes performance pressure → reduces anxiety → enables engagement |
| **Successful predictions** | Mastery experiences → builds confidence ("I can figure this out") |
| **Incremental complexity** | Scaffolded success → prevents overwhelming failure |
| **Peer discussion** | Vicarious experience → "If they got it, maybe I can too" |

**Key Predictions (Testable):**
- Math anxiety (MARS-R) should decrease after demo-based learning
- Self-efficacy for physics/math should increase
- Students with high initial anxiety should show disproportionate benefit (ceiling effect for low-anxiety students)
- Low-stakes exploration should produce better outcomes than high-stakes (graded) exploration

- Usher, E. L., & Pajares, F. (2008). Sources of self-efficacy in school: Critical review of the literature and future directions. *Review of Educational Research*, 78(4), 751-796.

**Strengths:**
- Directly addresses math anxiety (our stated concern)
- Well-validated with existing measurement scales
- Explains the *affective* outcomes, not just cognitive
- Connects to equity goals (anxiety disproportionately affects underrepresented students)

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't explain the cognitive mechanisms of learning
- Confidence ≠ competence (need to measure both)

---

### Integrated Theory of Change

**The Story We Tell Reviewers:**

> **Grounded cognition** provides the foundation: equations are visible alongside visualizations from the start, creating real-time perceptual-symbolic binding. Students don't learn equations as abstract symbol strings — they experience what equations *mean* through simultaneous manipulation and observation.
>
> **Productive failure** drives deep learning: students commit to predictions before running simulations. When predictions fail, the cognitive dissonance creates a "need to know" that makes the subsequent exploration meaningful. The equation, already grounded, becomes the tool for understanding why the prediction failed.

> **Self-efficacy** sustains engagement: low-stakes exploration builds confidence through repeated small successes. Students who feared equations discover they can *reason* about them, breaking the math anxiety cycle.
>
> The ultimate goal: **students come to prefer equations over words** as concise, powerful summaries of physical understanding. Astronomy becomes a modeling discipline, not a memorization exercise.

## Scope Strategy: Curriculum vs. Research

### The Challenge

We need **all three demo suites** (Stellar Structure, Galaxies, Cosmology) for the full ASTR 201 course redesign. But NSF reviewers may see three suites as overambitious for rigorous research.

### Key Insight: It's the Process, Not the Suites

The "treatment" isn't "Stellar Structure demos" vs. "Galaxies demos" — it's **demo-based pedagogy with equation grounding** as a whole-course intervention. The three suites are content vehicles, but the pedagogy is consistent throughout.

**This matters because:**
- Learning accumulates over the semester — "aha" moments may come mid-semester
- The pedagogical approach (predict-explore-explain, equations visible) is the intervention
- Transfer across suites tests whether equation fluency generalizes

---

### The Two-Contribution Model

| Contribution Type | Scope | Rigor Level | Deliverable |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Curriculum** | All 3 suites (25 demos) | Implementation quality | Open-source materials |
| **Research** | Whole-course intervention with module checkpoints | Publication quality | Learning trajectories + validated instrument |

**The pitch to reviewers:**

> "We contribute both *materials* (comprehensive demo suites for ASTR 201) and *knowledge* (rigorous study of how equation fluency develops over a semester). The curriculum provides the intervention; the research examines the trajectory of learning."

---

### Research Design: Whole-Course with Module Checkpoints

**The intervention is the entire semester.** We measure at multiple points to track learning trajectories, not just pre/post gains.

| Timepoint | When | Instruments | What It Captures |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Baseline (Pre)** | Week 1 | PIQL, MARS-R, Astro-EFI pilot, confidence survey | Starting point |
| **Checkpoint 1** | After Suite 1 (~Wk 5) | Mini-Astro-EFI (5-8 items), confidence, module reflection | Early grounding effects |
| **Checkpoint 2** | After Suite 2 (~Wk 10) | Mini-Astro-EFI, confidence, module reflection | Accumulation, pattern recognition |
| **Final (Post)** | After Suite 3 (~Wk 15) | Full battery: PIQL, MARS-R, Astro-EFI, equation preference, physical intuition | Final outcomes |
| **Longitudinal** | Subsequent courses | Upper-div grades, persistence | Transfer and retention |

**What checkpoints tell us:**
- **Learning curve shape:** Linear improvement? Sudden "click"? Plateau then breakthrough?
- **Suite differences:** Does equation fluency transfer across physics contexts?
- **Confidence trajectory:** Does self-efficacy build gradually or spike?
- **Dose-response:** Do more engaged students show steeper curves?

---

### Module Checkpoint Assessments

Each checkpoint (after completing a demo suite) includes:

#### 1. Mini Astro-EFI (5-8 items)
Quick assessment of equation fluency on that module's content:
- 2 Behavioral Prediction items
- 2 Dominant Term items
- 1-2 Misapplication Diagnosis items
- 1-2 Transfer items

#### 2. Confidence & Growth Survey (3-5 min)
```
On a scale of 1-5:
- How confident are you in your ability to predict what an equation will do?
- How confident are you in your physical intuition about [topic]?
- When explaining a concept, do you prefer to use equations or words?
  [ ] Strongly prefer words
  [ ] Somewhat prefer words
  [ ] No preference
  [ ] Somewhat prefer equations
  [ ] Strongly prefer equations
- Compared to the start of the course, my comfort with equations has:
  [ ] Decreased significantly
  [ ] Decreased somewhat
  [ ] Stayed the same
  [ ] Increased somewhat
  [ ] Increased significantly
```

#### 3. Module Reflection (brief open-ended)
- "What equation from this unit do you feel you understand most deeply? Why?"
- "Describe a moment when an equation 'clicked' for you."

---

### The Research Question (Refined)

> "How does equation fluency develop over a semester of demo-based instruction? What is the trajectory of learning, and what predicts faster/deeper development?"

**Sub-questions:**
1. Does equation preference shift from words → equations over the semester?
2. Does physical intuition grow alongside equation fluency, or separately?
3. At what point do students show confident equation use (if ever)?
4. Do patterns generalize across content areas (stellar → galaxies → cosmology)?

---

### Timeline Integration

| Year | Development | Research Focus |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Year 1** | All 3 suites (demos + Learning Glass) | Pilot checkpoints, calibrate instruments, qualitative exploration |
| **Year 2** | Refinement based on Year 1 | Full data collection, trajectory analysis |
| **Year 3** | Finalize materials for dissemination | Longitudinal tracking, validation study, publication |

**Note:** Demo development is rapid (AI-assisted). The research timeline is what paces the grant.

---

## Comparison Group Design

### The Ethical Dilemma

> "Is it ethical to have 'control' sections with traditional instruction if we believe demos are better?"

This is a real concern in education research. Pure randomized controlled trials (RCT) can be ethically problematic when we have reason to believe the intervention helps.

### Options for Comparison

#### Option 1: Historical Comparison (Weakest, but Ethical)
Compare demo cohorts to previous years taught traditionally.

| Year | Condition | N |
|------|-----------|---|
| 2024-2025 | Traditional (historical) | ~40-50 |
| 2026-2027 | Demo-based | ~40-50 |

**Limitations:** Confounded by time, instructor changes, student population shifts.

**When to use:** If no other option is feasible; acknowledge limitations explicitly.

---

#### Option 2: Waitlist/Delayed Implementation (Moderate)
If you teach multiple sections, implement demos in one section first.

| Semester | Section A | Section B |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Fall 2026 | Demos | Traditional |
| Spring 2027 | Demos | Demos (delayed) |

**Limitations:** Spillover effects if students talk; instructor effects if different instructors.

**When to use:** When you have multiple concurrent sections.

---

#### Option 3: Dose-Response (Recommended)
All students get demos, but you measure *engagement level* and correlate with outcomes.

| Variable | Measure |
|----------|---------|
| Demo engagement | Autolog data: time, explorations, predictions made |
| Equation Map quality | Scored rubric |
| Prediction accuracy | Embedded assessment |
| Outcome | PIQL, Astro-EFI, MARS-R |

**Analysis:** Do students who engage more deeply with demos show greater gains?

**Strengths:**
- Ethical (everyone gets intervention)
- Tests mechanism (engagement → learning)
- Uses rich autolog data you're already collecting

**Limitations:** Correlation ≠ causation; highly engaged students may differ in other ways.

---

#### Option 4: Component Analysis (Also Recommended)
Compare different "versions" of the intervention.

| Condition | Demos | Prediction Mode | Equation Maps |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Full | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Demos Only | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Demos + Prediction | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

**Analysis:** Which components matter? Does prediction mode add value beyond demos alone?

**Strengths:**
- Tests theoretical mechanisms
- Ethical (everyone gets some intervention)
- High scientific value

**Limitations:** Requires larger N to detect component effects; complex implementation.

---

### Recommended Approach

**Primary:** Dose-response design using autolog data
**Secondary:** Component analysis if N allows (compare cohorts/years with different features)
**Supplementary:** Historical comparison to establish baseline

**The pitch to reviewers:**

> "We employ a dose-response design that correlates engagement depth (measured via demo autologs) with learning outcomes. This approach is ethical (all students receive the intervention), leverages the rich data our platform collects, and tests the theoretical mechanism: that deeper engagement with predictions and exploration produces greater equation fluency gains."

---

## The Demo Suites

### Overview

Three comprehensive demo suites, each containing 8-9 interconnected demos that build toward a capstone synthesis experience.

| Suite | Focus | Key Equations | Demos |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Stellar Structure** | How stars work; equilibrium, energy, transport | HSE, mass continuity, energy generation, opacity | 8 demos |
| **Galaxies** | From light to mass; dark matter inference | Rotation curves, M/L ratios, virial theorem | 8 demos |
| **Cosmology** | The expanding universe; multi-probe inference | Friedmann equation, distance measures, BAO | 9 demos |

---

### Learning Glass Lectures: Theory Before Exploration

**Critical Clarification:** Demos do NOT replace traditional instruction. They AUGMENT it.

Students still need:
- Full theoretical background (derivations, context, physical meaning)
- Traditional homework with problem solving and algebraic manipulation
- Practice with calculation to prepare for upper-division courses

**The Complete Pedagogical Cycle:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BEFORE CLASS: Learning Glass Lecture (~15 min)                  │
│   - Full theory: derivations, physical meaning, context         │
│   - Equations introduced with explanation of each term          │
│   - "Here's where this equation comes from and what it means"   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IN CLASS: Demo Exploration + Discussion                         │
│   - Ground the equations from the lecture                       │
│   - Predict-explore-explain cycle                               │
│   - Peer discussion, Equation Maps                              │
│   - Connect visual intuition to mathematical formalism          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HOMEWORK: Traditional Problem Sets                              │
│   - Algebraic manipulation practice                             │
│   - Quantitative calculation problems                           │
│   - Problem-solving skill development                           │
│   - Derivation practice where appropriate                       │
│   - Prepares students for upper-div mathematical rigor          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SYNTHESIS: Memos (3 per semester)                               │
│   - Integration of theory + exploration + calculation           │
│   - Demonstrate equation ownership in writing                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Key Insight:** Demos don't replace math practice — they make the math *meaningful*. When students do algebraic manipulation in homework, they understand what they're manipulating. The grounding makes the practice stick.

---

### Learning Glass Lecture Structure (~15 min each, before each class)

Each class session is preceded by a Learning Glass video (flipped classroom model).

**Video Structure:**

| Component | Duration | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Motivation** | 2-3 min | Why does this matter? What problem are we solving? |
| **Physical Setup** | 2-3 min | The system, assumptions, what we're modeling |
| **Derivation/Equation** | 5-7 min | Where the equation comes from, term-by-term explanation |
| **Limiting Cases** | 2-3 min | What happens when X >> Y? When does this break down? |
| **Preview of Exploration** | 1-2 min | "In class, you'll test these predictions in the demo..." |

**Why ~15 min:**
- Long enough for real content (not superficial)
- Short enough to maintain attention
- Students can rewatch difficult parts
- Frees class time for active learning

---

### Homework: Traditional Problem Solving Still Essential

**Demos ground understanding. Homework builds fluency.**

Students still need to:
1. **Manipulate equations algebraically** — solve for different variables, combine equations
2. **Do calculations** — plug in numbers, get answers, check units
3. **Work through derivations** — reproduce key results, extend to new cases
4. **Solve novel problems** — apply equations to situations not covered in demos

**Sample HW Problem Types:**

| Type | Example | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Calculation** | "Calculate the central pressure of a 2 M☉ star with R = 1.5 R☉" | Practice with numbers, units |
| **Algebraic manipulation** | "Starting from HSE, derive the scaling P_c ∝ M²/R⁴" | Equation fluency |
| **Limiting cases** | "Show that for n=3 polytrope, M ∝ R⁰ (mass independent of radius)" | Physical insight |
| **Application** | "A white dwarf has M = 0.6 M☉, R = 0.01 R☉. Is it supported by ideal gas or degeneracy pressure?" | Transfer |
| **Estimation** | "Estimate the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale for the Sun. How does this compare to its age?" | Order-of-magnitude reasoning |

**The Goal:** By doing both demos AND traditional homework:
- Students understand what equations mean (from demos)
- Students can manipulate equations fluently (from homework)
- Students are prepared for upper-division courses that assume mathematical comfort

---

### Matt Anderson's Learning Glass Format

**Technical setup:**
- Transparent glass board, instructor writes while explaining
- Camera captures instructor's face AND writing simultaneously
- Equations appear as natural part of explanation (not slides)
- Feels like one-on-one tutoring, not lecture

**Pedagogical advantages:**
- Students see the *process* of writing/thinking, not just final equations
- Instructor can point to specific terms while explaining
- More personal than traditional lecture capture
- Rewindable — students can replay difficult derivations

**Integration with demos:**
- Each video ends with prediction questions for the upcoming demo
- Students watch video → come to class with framework → explore in demo
- Demo autologs can track whether students watched the video (engagement metric)

---

### Shared Infrastructure: The "Cosmic Core"

All demos share:

- **Equation Display Panel:** Shows relevant equations with term-by-term highlighting as parameters change
- **Model Card:** Explains assumptions, valid ranges, what the model omits
- **Prediction Mode:** Students commit predictions before seeing results
- **Autologging:** Records exploration path for research and assessment
- **Export:** Figures, parameters, and exploration logs exportable for memos

### Suite 1: Stellar Structure (8 Demos)

| 1 | Scale Factor | Expansion, a(t), Hubble parameter | $H = \dot{a}/a$ |
| 2 | Redshift | Cosmological vs. Doppler | $1 + z = a_0/a_{emit}$ |
| 3 | Distance Measures | $D_L$, $D_A$, $D_C$ and their differences | $D_L = (1+z) D_C$ |
| 4 | Friedmann Equation | Expansion dynamics, components | $H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2}$ |
| 5 | Thermal History | Temperature evolution, decoupling | $T \propto 1/a$ |
| 6 | Recombination | Last scattering, CMB origin | Saha equation |
| 7 | BAO | Sound horizon, standard ruler | $r_s = \int_0^{t_{dec}} c_s \, dt$ |
| 8 | Structure Growth | Linear perturbations, $\sigma_8$ | $\delta \propto D(a)$ |
| 9 | Probes Lab | Multi-probe inference, degeneracies | $\chi^2$ minimization |

**Capstone Challenge:** Use at least two cosmological probes to constrain $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$. Explain why combining probes breaks degeneracies.

### New Assessments: Confidence, Intuition, and Equation Preference

#### The Ultimate Goal

> **By the end of the semester, students should prefer equations over words** as concise summaries of physical understanding. They should see astrophysics as a modeling discipline grounded in equations — not an Astro 101 textbook of facts to memorize.

This is a measurable shift in attitude, not just skill.

---

#### Equation Preference Scale (Pre/Post)

**Purpose:** Measure whether students' attitudes toward equations shift from "barrier" to "tool."

**Sample items (5-point Likert scale: Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree):**

1. When explaining a physics concept, I prefer to use words rather than equations.
2. Equations feel like obstacles that get in the way of my understanding.
3. I find equations to be elegant, concise summaries of physical relationships.
4. If I had to teach someone about stellar structure, I would rely mostly on words and diagrams, not equations.
5. When I see an equation, I can usually picture what it means physically.
6. I trust an explanation more when it includes supporting equations.
7. Given the choice, I would rather reason through a problem with equations than with verbal descriptions.

**Scoring:** Items 1, 2, 4 are reverse-scored. Higher scores = greater equation preference.

**Hypothesis:** Post-course scores should be significantly higher than pre-course scores, indicating a shift toward equation preference.

---

#### Confidence in Quantitative Reasoning (Checkpoints)

**Purpose:** Track confidence growth over the semester. Part of module checkpoint surveys.

**Items:**

1. **General confidence:** "How confident are you in your ability to reason quantitatively about physical systems?" (1-5)

2. **Prediction confidence:** "How confident are you that you can predict what an equation will do before calculating?" (1-5)

3. **Physical intuition:** "How confident are you in your physical intuition about [MODULE TOPIC]?" (1-5)

4. **Growth perception:** "Compared to the start of the course, my comfort with equations has: Decreased significantly / Decreased somewhat / Stayed the same / Increased somewhat / Increased significantly"

---

#### Physical Intuition Assessment (Pre/Post)

**Purpose:** Measure whether students can make correct physical predictions WITHOUT explicit calculation.

**Format:** Short scenarios where students predict outcomes based on physical reasoning.

**Example items:**

1. **Stellar Structure:**
   > A star contracts slightly while maintaining the same mass. Without calculating, predict what happens to its central pressure: Increases / Decreases / Stays the same. *Briefly explain your reasoning.*

2. **Galaxies:**
   > You observe two galaxies with identical luminosities, but Galaxy A has a rotation curve that rises steeply and Galaxy B has one that rises slowly. Which galaxy likely has more mass concentrated in its center? *Explain.*

3. **Cosmology:**
   > If the universe had more matter density, would the age of the universe (time since Big Bang) be older or younger than our current estimate? *Explain without using equations.*

**Scoring:** Credit for correct answer + physically sound reasoning. Captures intuition independent of calculation skill.

---

#### Module Reflection Questions (Qualitative)

At each checkpoint, open-ended questions to capture qualitative shifts:

1. "What equation from this unit do you feel you understand most deeply? Why?"
2. "Describe a moment when something 'clicked' for you this unit."
3. "If you had to explain [key concept] to a friend, would you use an equation? Why or why not?"
4. "Has your relationship with equations changed since the start of the semester? How?"

**Analysis:** Qualitative coding for themes of equation ownership, confidence, and modeling mindset.

## Measuring Equation Fluency: The Assessment Strategy

### The Measurement Problem

**Core challenge:** "Equation fluency" as we've defined it—the ability to predict equation behavior, identify dominant terms, diagnose misapplication, and transfer understanding—is not well-captured by existing validated instruments. This creates a tension:

1. **Validated instruments** (PIQL, QuaRCS) measure related constructs but may miss what makes demo-based learning unique
2. **New instrument development** is publishable and high-impact, but requires psychometrics expertise and significant effort
3. **Custom tasks** capture exactly what we want to measure, but lack validation

**Our solution:** A hybrid approach that adapts existing instruments while piloting astronomy-specific equation fluency tasks.

---

### Related Existing Instruments

#### 1. Symbol Sense (Arcavi, 1994)

**What it is:** Math education construct about "when and how to use symbols"—reading *through* algebraic expressions to understand meaning, not just manipulating them.

**Relevance:** Closest conceptually to equation fluency. Includes:
- Recognizing that symbols represent quantities that vary
- Understanding the structure of an expression (which parts dominate)
- Connecting symbolic and graphical representations

**Limitation:** Not a validated instrument; more of a theoretical framework. No items we can directly use.

#### 2. PIQL (Physics Inventory of Quantitative Literacy)

**What it is:** 20-item validated instrument measuring:
- Proportional reasoning
- Covariation (how quantities change together)
- Signed quantities and negative rates
- Reasoning with ratios

**Sample item type:** "If A doubles and B stays the same, what happens to C = A/B?"

**Relevance:** Captures some of the quantitative reasoning underlying equation fluency. Well-validated, published, used in physics education research.

**Limitation:** Focuses on general reasoning, not equation interpretation in physics contexts. Doesn't assess whether students can "read" a physics equation and predict behavior.

**Citation:** White Brahmia, S., Boudreaux, A., & Kanim, S. E. (2016). Developing Mathematization with Physics Inventory of Quantitative Literacy. *PERC Proceedings*.

#### 3. QuaRCS (Quantitative Reasoning for College Science)

**What it is:** Assessment developed specifically for Astro 101 at University of Arizona measuring:
- Quantitative skills (arithmetic, estimation, graphs)
- Quantitative attitudes (math anxiety, self-efficacy)

**Relevance:**
- Already astronomy-contextualized
- Includes attitudes/anxiety measures (which we care about)
- Validated with intro astro students

**Limitation:** More about general quantitative literacy than equation-specific fluency. Appropriate for 101, may be too basic for 201.

**Citation:** Follette, K., McCarthy, D., Dokter, E., Bursick, S., & Pompea, S. (2017). The Quantitative Reasoning for College Science (QuaRCS) Assessment 1. *Numeracy*, 10(2), Article 3.

#### 4. MARS-R (Math Anxiety Rating Scale - Revised)

**What it is:** Validated 30-item scale measuring math anxiety across dimensions:
- Math test anxiety
- Numerical task anxiety
- Math course anxiety

**Relevance:** Directly measures math anxiety, which is one of our primary outcomes.

**Limitation:** Measures anxiety, not fluency. Useful for pre/post comparison but doesn't capture skill development.

---

### The Hybrid Strategy: Astro-EFI (Equation Fluency Inventory)

**Approach:** Adapt PIQL structure and validation methodology, but with astronomy-specific equation fluency items. This is a recognized methodology in education research called **instrument adaptation**.

#### Phase 1: Use Existing Instruments (Year 1)

| Instrument | Use | Purpose |
|------------|-----|---------|
| **PIQL** | Pre/post | Baseline quantitative reasoning; comparison to literature |
| **QuaRCS (attitudes subscale)** | Pre/post | Math anxiety, self-efficacy |
| **MARS-R (short form)** | Pre/post | Detailed math anxiety measure |

These provide validated, publishable outcomes while we develop the custom instrument.

#### Phase 2: Pilot Astro-EFI Items (Years 1-2)

Develop 15-20 astronomy-specific equation fluency items using PIQL-style validation:
1. **Expert review** (5+ astronomy/physics faculty evaluate items)
2. **Cognitive interviews** (10-15 students think aloud while answering)
3. **Pilot administration** (n = 100+ students)
4. **Item analysis** (difficulty, discrimination, factor structure)

#### Phase 3: Validate & Publish (Year 3+)

- Publish validated Astro-EFI with psychometric properties
- Compare Astro-EFI gains to PIQL gains to test whether demos build *equation-specific* skills beyond general reasoning
- Make instrument freely available for other researchers

---

### Equation Fluency Task Types (Astro-EFI Items)

Based on our definition of equation fluency, items should assess four competencies:

#### Type 1: Behavioral Prediction
*"Before calculating, predict what the equation will do."*

**Example (Hydrostatic Equilibrium):**
> The central pressure of a star is given by $P_c \propto \frac{M^2}{R^4}$.
>
> If a star's mass doubles while its radius stays constant, the central pressure will:
> - (a) Double
> - (b) Quadruple
> - (c) Stay the same
> - (d) Decrease by half

**What it measures:** Can the student read the equation structure and predict behavior without calculating?

---

#### Type 2: Dominant Term Identification
*"Which part of the equation matters most in this regime?"*

**Example (Friedmann Equation):**
> The Friedmann equation is $H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}(\rho_m + \rho_r + \rho_\Lambda) - \frac{kc^2}{a^2}$.
>
> At very early times when the universe was hot and dense, which term dominated?
> - (a) Matter density ($\rho_m$)
> - (b) Radiation density ($\rho_r$)
> - (c) Dark energy ($\rho_\Lambda$)
> - (d) Curvature ($k$)
>
> *Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.*

**What it measures:** Does the student understand how different terms scale with conditions?

---

#### Type 3: Misapplication Diagnosis
*"Why doesn't this equation apply here?"*

**Example (Rotation Curves):**
> A student uses $v = \sqrt{GM/r}$ to predict that velocity should decrease with radius for a spiral galaxy. But observed rotation curves are flat (constant v at large r).
>
> What is the most likely explanation?
> - (a) The equation is wrong
> - (b) The assumption of point mass doesn't apply to extended mass distributions
> - (c) Observations are incorrect
> - (d) Velocity isn't measurable at large radii

**What it measures:** Can the student identify when model assumptions break down?

---

#### Type 4: Transfer / Analogy
*"Apply the same equation structure to a new context."*

**Example (Virial Theorem):**
> The virial theorem relates kinetic and potential energy: $2K + U = 0$ (for bound systems).
>
> In a galaxy cluster, this allows us to estimate total mass from observed velocities. A colleague proposes using the same approach to estimate the mass of a passing asteroid near Earth.
>
> Why would this **not** work?
> - (a) The virial theorem only applies to stars
> - (b) The asteroid is not a bound, virialized system
> - (c) Asteroids are too small to have significant gravity
> - (d) We can't measure asteroid velocities

**What it measures:** Can the student recognize when equation structures do/don't transfer?

---

### Embedded Assessment Tasks (Simulation-Based)

In addition to paper-and-pencil items, we'll develop **embedded assessment tasks** within the demos themselves:

#### Prediction Mode Assessment

Before running any simulation, students must:
1. **Commit a prediction** (slider position, qualitative direction, or multiple choice)
2. **State confidence** (1-5 scale)
3. **Run simulation** and see actual result
4. **Explain discrepancy** if prediction was wrong

**Data captured:**
- Prediction accuracy over time (learning curve)
- Confidence calibration (overconfidence decreases?)
- Quality of explanations (coded qualitatively)

#### Exploration Pattern Analytics

Demo autologs capture:
- Which parameters students explore
- Order of exploration (systematic vs. random)
- Time spent on equation panel vs. visualization
- Whether students use "compare mode" to test hypotheses

**Research question:** Do exploration patterns predict equation fluency gains?

---

### Validation Strategy

| Phase | Activity | Timeline | Sample Size |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **1. Item Development** | Write 25-30 candidate items across all 4 types | Year 1, Sem 1 | N/A |
| **2. Expert Review** | 5+ faculty rate items for clarity, validity, difficulty | Year 1, Sem 1 | 5-7 experts |
| **3. Cognitive Interviews** | Students think aloud while answering; identify confusion | Year 1, Sem 2 | 12-15 students |
| **4. Pilot Administration** | Administer full item pool to assess psychometrics | Year 2 | n = 120-150 |
| **5. Item Analysis** | Difficulty, discrimination, factor analysis, reliability | Year 2 | - |
| **6. Final Instrument** | Select 15-20 items with best properties | Year 2-3 | - |
| **7. Validation Study** | Test against PIQL, grades, expert ratings | Year 3 | n = 100+ |

---

### How This Positions the Research

**The contribution is three-fold:**

1. **Primary outcomes** use validated instruments (PIQL, QuaRCS, MARS-R)
   - Satisfies reviewers
   - Comparable to existing literature
   - Publishable even if Astro-EFI development is incomplete

2. **Secondary outcomes** use the new Astro-EFI
   - Tests whether demos build *equation-specific* skills beyond general reasoning
   - Generates pilot data for future instrument validation grant

3. **Exploratory outcomes** use embedded simulation tasks
   - Rich process data on how students learn
   - Qualitative insights that inform theory

**The framing to reviewers:**

> "We use established validated instruments for our primary outcomes while simultaneously piloting a new assessment—the Astronomy Equation Fluency Inventory (Astro-EFI)—that targets the specific skills demo-based learning develops. This mixed approach ensures rigorous, publishable findings while advancing assessment methodology in astronomy education."

## Research Methodology

### Study Design

**Mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design with longitudinal tracking**

#### Quantitative Components

1. **Pre/Post Assessment:** Math anxiety, equation fluency, conceptual understanding
2. **Comparison Groups:** Demo-based sections vs. traditional sections (where available)
3. **Longitudinal Tracking:** Follow students into upper-division courses
4. **Learning Analytics:** Demo autologs provide fine-grained data on exploration patterns

2. **Interview Studies:** How do students describe their relationship with equations?
3. **Instructor Interviews:** What challenges arise in implementation?

### Sample Size and Power

For detecting medium effect sizes (d = 0.5) on math anxiety reduction:
- Minimum n = 64 per group (α = 0.05, power = 0.80)

## Expected Outcomes

### For Students

| Outcome | Metric | Target |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Reduced math anxiety** | MARS-R score decrease | >0.5 SD reduction |
| **Improved quantitative reasoning** | PIQL score | >0.3 normalized gain |
| **Improved equation fluency** | Astro-EFI | Positive correlation with demo engagement |
| **Better prediction accuracy** | Embedded prediction tasks | Improvement trajectory over semester |
| **Increased confidence** | Confidence survey | Significant pre→post increase |
| **Shift to equation preference** | Equation Preference Scale | Net positive shift (words → equations) |
| **Stronger physical intuition** | Physical Intuition Assessment | Pre→post improvement |
| **Lower DFW rates** | Course grades | 40-50% reduction |
| **Upper-div success** | Grades in 301/302/303 | Improved vs. historical |

### The "Equation Preference" Outcome (Primary Novel Outcome)

**The signature result we're seeking:**

> By semester's end, students express preference for equations as explanatory tools — they see equations not as barriers but as elegant, concise summaries of physical understanding.

This is measurable via:
1. Equation Preference Scale (quantitative pre/post)
2. Module reflections (qualitative shift in language)
3. Synthesis memos (voluntary use of equations when words would suffice)

**Why this matters:** This represents a fundamental shift in relationship with mathematics — the transition from "math avoider" to "equation owner."

### For the Field

1. **Open-source demo suites** available to any institution
2. **Validated assessment instruments** (Astro-EFI, Equation Preference Scale)
3. **Learning Glass video library** for theory introduction
4. **Implementation guides** for instructors adopting demo-based pedagogy
5. **Research publications** on equation fluency development trajectories
6. **Replication package** for other institutions to conduct similar studies

### For SDSU

1. Transformed ASTR 201 with documented learning gains
2. Improved pipeline to upper-division and graduate programs
3. National visibility in astronomy education research
4. Foundation for future education research grants
5. Model for other physics-heavy courses (PHYS 195, etc.)

---

## How This Builds on Grant 1

| Grant 1 (ASTR 101/201 Basics) | Grant 2 (Advanced Suites) |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Foundational demos for intro courses | Comprehensive suites for model-based reasoning |
| Proof of concept: demos improve engagement | Research question: do demos improve equation fluency? |
| Basic implementation guidance | Full pedagogical framework + assessment |
| Preliminary learning outcomes data | Rigorous quasi-experimental design |
| Single-institution pilot | Multi-section comparison; replication potential |

**The Logic:** Grant 1 proves that interactive demos work for intro astronomy. Grant 2 asks: *Can they solve the harder problem of math anxiety and equation fluency in physics-heavy courses?*

## Alignment with NSF IUSE Goals

### The Novelty Pitch

**Most STEM education research stops at the intro course.** We're asking: *What happens next?*

PhET simulations transformed how we teach Physics 101. Studio physics revolutionized introductory mechanics. But those students still hit a wall when they reach intermediate courses where equations become unavoidable.

**This proposal fills a critical gap:**

| What Exists | What's Missing (Our Contribution) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Intro-level simulations (PhET, etc.) | Intermediate-level simulations with real physics depth |
| Conceptual inventories for 101 | Equation fluency assessments for 201 |
| "Active learning works" (general) | "Active learning helps with math anxiety" (specific) |
| Studio physics for intro courses | Studio astrophysics for the major pipeline |

**The reviewer should think:** "This isn't just another active learning study—it's targeting the course level where students decide whether they can *become* physicists."

---

### Engaged Student Learning (Track 1)

- Develops evidence-based instructional materials for an **understudied course level**
- Targets known barrier (math anxiety) in STEM persistence
- Builds on prior work (Grant 1) with expanded scope
- Addresses the "valley of death" between intro and upper-div courses

### Institutional and Community Transformation (Track 2)

- Changes how ASTR 201 is taught at SDSU
- Provides materials for adoption at other institutions
- Contributes to national conversation on equation fluency
- Could catalyze similar efforts in Physics 201, Chemistry 201, etc.

### The AI-Era Framing (For Reviewers)

**Lead with this:** "We are preparing students for a STEM workforce where AI handles routine calculations. The skills that remain valuable—physical intuition, model evaluation, anomaly detection—are precisely what demo-based learning develops."

This reframes the proposal from "incremental pedagogy improvement" to "essential workforce preparation." It's not just about teaching astronomy better; it's about teaching the skills AI can't replace.

### IUSE Review Criteria

| Criterion | How This Proposal Addresses It |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Intellectual Merit** | Novel research on equation fluency at intermediate level; fills gap in literature; new assessment instruments; addresses AI-era skill needs |
| **Broader Impacts** | Open-source materials; math anxiety reduction benefits underrepresented groups disproportionately; transferable to other STEM disciplines; prepares students for AI-augmented workforce |
| **Evidence Base** | Builds on established active learning research; adds new dimension (equation fluency); targets understudied population; responds to documented workforce skill shifts |
| **Assessment Plan** | Mixed-methods with validated instruments; longitudinal tracking into upper-div courses; multi-institution replication |
| **Sustainability** | Open-source; integrated into curriculum; training materials for adopters; transferable pedagogical framework |

---

## Grant Landscape: Beyond IUSE

### SDSU's HSI Status Is an Underutilized Asset

SDSU is a **Hispanic-Serving Institution** (HSI), which opens doors to dedicated NSF funding streams with *lower competition* than general IUSE. These programs explicitly fund STEM education research at HSIs.

---

### NSF HSI Programs ⭐ (High Priority)

#### [HSI: Equitable Transformation in STEM Education (ETSE)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/hispanic-serving-institutions-equitable-transformation-stem/506287/nsf24-578)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Focus** | Institutional transformation + STEM education research |
| **Encourages** | Projects on AI, emerging technologies (explicitly!) |
| **Tracks** | Track 2 (Implementation) or Track 3 (Institutional Transformation) |
| **Fit** | Math anxiety research + equation fluency + AI-resistant skills |

**Why this is ideal for Grant 2:** The HSI-ETSE program explicitly encourages projects focused on "artificial intelligence" and "emerging technologies." Our framing of "AI-resistant skills" aligns perfectly. The equity angle (math anxiety disproportionately affects underrepresented students) strengthens the case.

#### [HSI: Enriching Learning, Programs, and Student Experiences (ELPSE)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/hsielpse-hispanic-serving-institutions-enriching-learning-programs/nsf24-551/solicitation)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Goal** | Increase recruitment, retention, graduation in STEM |
| **Tracks** | PPP (Planning/Pilot), IEP (Implementation), EI (Educational Instrumentation) |
| **Fit** | Demos + Learning Glass directly address retention at the 201 level |

**Strategic option:** Submit Grant 1 to general IUSE, then submit Grant 2 (or a parallel proposal) to HSI-ETSE with different framing. Same demos, different emphasis: "increasing retention of Hispanic students through reduction of math anxiety."

---

### [NSF CAREER Award](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/career-faculty-early-career-development-program) (If Eligible)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Award** | $400K-500K over 5 years |
| **Requirement** | Integrated education plan that is "distinctive, innovative, and beyond typical" |
| **Deadline** | July 23, 2025 (and annually) |
| **Eligibility** | Early-career tenure-track faculty |

**Why this fits:** The CAREER award requires an education component that is genuinely integrated with research. Your demo-based pedagogy + math anxiety/equation fluency research is exactly this kind of integration—not a tacked-on "broader impacts" section, but a genuine research program on teaching.

**The pitch:** "My research develops pedagogies for AI-resistant STEM competencies, using astronomy as a testbed for interventions that transfer to physics, engineering, and beyond."

⚠️ *Note: Monitor CAREER program funding under current administration.*

### Strategic Grant Sequencing

| Grant | Timing | Amount | Focus |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Grant 1: IUSE Level 1** | Mid-July 2026 | ~$300K | ASTR 101/201 foundational demos |
| **Grant 1b: HSI-ELPSE** | Parallel or shortly after | ~$300-500K | Same work, HSI framing (retention focus) |
| **Cottrell Scholar** | July 2025 (if eligible) | $120K | Integrated research/teaching program |
| **Grant 2: HSI-ETSE** | Year 2-3 of Grant 1 | ~$500K-1M | Advanced suites + ASTR 201 redesign + AI-skills framing |
| **Heising-Simons** | Opportunistic | $20-80K | Workshop or pilot for multi-institution collaboration |

### The HSI Advantage: Lower Competition

| Grant Type | Applicant Pool | Competition Level |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| General IUSE | All US institutions | **High** |
| HSI-ELPSE / HSI-ETSE | Only HSIs (~500 institutions) | **Lower** |
| CAREER | All early-career faculty | **Very High** |
| Cottrell Scholar | Early-career in specific fields | **High** |

**The math:** There are ~4,000 degree-granting institutions in the US, but only ~500 HSIs. The applicant pool for HSI programs is 1/8 the size of general programs. Your odds are significantly better.

## Open Questions / Needs Further Development

### Research Design
1. ~~**Equation Fluency Inventory:** Does a validated instrument exist, or do we need to develop one?~~ → **RESOLVED:** See [Measuring Equation Fluency](#measuring-equation-fluency-the-assessment-strategy) section. Strategy: Use validated PIQL/QuaRCS/MARS-R for primary outcomes; develop Astro-EFI as secondary contribution.
2. ~~**Comparison Group Ethics:** Is it ethical to have "control" sections with traditional instruction if we believe demos are better?~~ → **RESOLVED:** See [Comparison Group Design](#comparison-group-design) section. Use dose-response design with autolog data as primary; component analysis as secondary.
3. ~~**Theoretical Framework:** What's the theory of change?~~ → **RESOLVED:** See [Theoretical Framework](#theoretical-framework) section. Primary: Productive Failure; Secondary: Self-Efficacy; Supporting: Grounded Cognition.
4. ~~**Scope:** Is three demo suites too ambitious?~~ → **RESOLVED:** See [Scope Strategy](#scope-strategy-curriculum-vs-research) section. Separate curriculum contribution (all 3 suites) from research contribution (primary + replication design).

### Still Open

#### Partnerships & Scale
5. **Multi-Institution Partners:** Who are the right partners? → See [Potential Collaborators](#potential-collaborators) for placeholder; need to identify specific institutions after Grant 1 shows results.
6. **PER/AER Collaborators:** Who in the physics/astronomy education research community should we bring in? → See [Potential Collaborators](#potential-collaborators) for candidates; need to reach out.

#### Timing & Strategy
7. **Timing:** When to submit Grant 2?
   - Option A: Submit in Year 2 of Grant 1 (use preliminary data)
   - Option B: Submit in Year 3 of Grant 1 (use fuller results)
   - **Tentative decision:** Year 2-3, depending on Grant 1 data
8. **Lead Angle:** Which framing resonates most with IUSE reviewers?
   - Current thinking: Lead with "equation fluency" (novel), support with "math anxiety" (established), frame with "AI-resistant skills" (timely)

#### Sustainability
9. **Post-Grant Maintenance:** Who maintains the demos after the grant ends?
   - Potential: GitHub open-source community maintenance
   - Potential: SDSU instructional technology support
   - **Need:** Explicit sustainability plan in proposal
10. **Adoption Pathway:** How do other institutions actually adopt this?
    - Need: Clear documentation, instructor training materials
    - Need: Workshop or summer institute for adopters
    - **Consider:** Heising-Simons grant for dissemination workshop
