**Name:** ________________________________  **Section:** __________  **Date:** __________

**Station:** __________  **Group members:** ________________________________________________

*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: Binary Orbits (6–8 minutes)**
> **Controls:** $M_1$, $M_2$, separation $a$, eccentricity $e$  
> **Overlays:** barycenter, velocity vectors
>
> **Your station artifact (fill in):**
> 1) **Observation:** In the Sun + Jupiter system, which body’s orbit is larger? By roughly what factor?  
> 2) **Rule:** Write a relationship between orbit sizes and masses (in words or a ratio).  
> 3) **Prediction:** If you doubled Jupiter’s mass, what would happen to the Sun’s wobble (bigger/smaller, and why)?  
> 4) **Exoplanet connection:** How could an astronomer detect a Jupiter-sized planet using only the star’s light?  
> 5) **Connection sentence:** “This connects to another course idea because…”

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Barycenter:** the center of mass; both bodies orbit this point.
> - **Mass ratio:** if one mass is larger, the barycenter sits closer to that body.
> - **Orbit size about the barycenter:** the more massive body has the smaller orbit.
> - **Radial velocity method:** detect a planet by measuring the star’s back-and-forth Doppler shift.
>
> **Key relationship (mass vs orbit size):**
>
> $$\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{M_2}{M_1}$$
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - If $M_1=M_2$, both orbits should be the same size (mirror symmetry).
> - Making the planet more massive increases the star’s wobble (harder pull → larger response).
> - The star’s wobble is usually much smaller than the planet’s orbit.
