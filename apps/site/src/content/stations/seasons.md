**Station:** __________  **Group members:** ________________________________________________

*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: Seasons (6–8 minutes)**
> **Demo setup:** defaults → then click **June Solstice** and **December Solstice**.  
> **Tip:** Click **Station Mode** to add anchor-date rows and print/copy your table.
>
> **Your station artifact (fill in):**
> 1) **Control(s):** tilt $\varepsilon$, day of year, latitude $\phi$  
> 2) **Observable(s):** day length, noon altitude, season labels  
> 3) **Governing relationship:** write one sentence connecting $\varepsilon$ → $\delta$ → day length  
> 4) **Sanity check:** what happens when $\varepsilon=0^\circ$?  
> 5) **Connection sentence:** “This matters for eclipses/phases because…”

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Axial tilt $\varepsilon$ (degrees):** tilt of Earth’s spin axis relative to its orbital plane.
> - **Solar declination $\delta$ (degrees):** the Sun’s “latitude” on the sky; it sets where the noon Sun is highest.
> - **Noon altitude (degrees):** the Sun’s height above the horizon at local noon.
> - **Day length (hours):** total daylight time in a day at a latitude.
> - **Equinox:** $\delta \approx 0^\circ$; day and night are about equal.
> - **Solstice:** $|\delta|$ is largest; one hemisphere has its longest day and highest noon Sun.
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - If $\varepsilon=0^\circ$, then $\delta=0^\circ$ all year → day length stays about 12 h (no seasons).
> - June vs December: at the same latitude, the hemisphere facing the Sun has longer days and a higher noon Sun.
> - Perihelion is in early January, so Earth–Sun distance does not line up with Northern Hemisphere summer.
