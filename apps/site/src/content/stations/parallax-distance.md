**Name:** ________________________________  **Section:** __________  **Date:** __________

**Station:** __________  **Group members:** ________________________________________________

*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: Parallax Distance (6–8 minutes)**
> **Artifact:** a “parallax card” with one numeric example + one sentence interpretation.
>
> At the station, produce:
> - A chosen parallax $p$ (in arcsec or mas) and the corresponding distance $d$ (pc),
> - One sentence: “Because $p$ decreases as $d$ increases, this star is [near/far] compared to ____.”
> - One note about measurement: “This is (hard/easy) to measure because $p$ is (small/large) compared to the uncertainty.”

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Parallax:** an apparent shift caused by a change in viewpoint (here: Jan vs July).
> - **Parallax angle $p$:** the measured angle; larger $p$ means the star is closer.
> - **Parsec (pc):** defined so that:
>
>   $$d\,(\mathrm{pc})=\frac{1}{p\,(\mathrm{arcsec})}$$
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - If $d=1\,\mathrm{pc}$, then $p=1\,\mathrm{arcsec}$.
> - If distance increases by $10\times$, parallax should decrease by $10\times$.
> - Distant stars have tiny parallax angles (mas or $\mu\mathrm{as}$).
