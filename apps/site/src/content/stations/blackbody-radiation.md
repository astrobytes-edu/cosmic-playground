*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: Blackbody Radiation (6–8 minutes)**
> Pick one preset (**M dwarf**, **Sun**, **A/B star**, or **CMB**) and record:
> - Temperature $T$ (K)
> - Peak wavelength $\lambda_{\text{peak}}$ (nm)
> - Which band dominates (IR / visible / UV / microwave)
>
> Then write one sentence:
> > “This star looks ____ because its blackbody peak is at ____.”

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Blackbody spectrum:** the ideal “thermal glow” curve; temperature sets its shape.
> - **Temperature $T$ (K):** hotter objects emit more and peak at shorter wavelengths.
> - **Peak wavelength $\lambda_{\text{peak}}$:** where the curve is highest (the “peak marker”).
>
> **Key relationship (Wien scaling):**
>
> $$\lambda_{\text{peak}} \propto \frac{1}{T}$$
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - Hotter → $\lambda_{\text{peak}}$ shifts to *shorter* wavelength (toward blue/UV).
> - Cooler → $\lambda_{\text{peak}}$ shifts to *longer* wavelength (toward red/IR).
> - In astronomy, “redder” blackbodies are **cooler**, not hotter.
