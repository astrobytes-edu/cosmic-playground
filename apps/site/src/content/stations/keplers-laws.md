**Name:** ________________________________  **Section:** __________  **Date:** __________

**Station:** __________  **Group members:** ________________________________________________

*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: Kepler’s Laws (6–8 minutes)**
> **Controls:** $a$, $e$, time (mean anomaly $M$, deg) (and in Newton mode: central mass $M$, $M_{\odot}$)  
> **Overlays:** foci, apsides, equal areas, vectors
>
> **Your station artifact (fill in):**
> 1) **Observation:** where is the planet fastest (perihelion or aphelion)?  
> 2) **Kepler law:** explain using “equal areas in equal times.”  
> 3) **Geometry:** identify perihelion and aphelion in the orbit.  
> 4) **Scaling:** if $a$ doubles (same $M$), what happens to $P$ (longer/shorter, and why)?  
> 5) **Connection sentence:** “This connects to another course idea because…”

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Semi-major axis $a$ (AU):** the orbit’s size scale.
> - **Eccentricity $e$ (unitless):** orbit shape (0 = circle; larger = more stretched).
> - **Perihelion / aphelion:** closest / farthest point from the star.
> - **Kepler 2:** equal areas in equal times (a timing law → speed changes).
> - **Kepler 3:** bigger orbits have longer periods (for the same central mass).
>
> **Key relationship (period scaling):**
>
> $$P \propto a^{3/2}$$
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - If $e=0$, speed should be constant around the orbit.
> - For an ellipse, the planet should move fastest at perihelion.
> - Increasing $a$ should increase the period $P$.
