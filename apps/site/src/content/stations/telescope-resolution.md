*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: Telescope Resolution (6–8 minutes)**
> **Artifact:** a “can this telescope resolve it?” card.
>
> Choose:
> - one telescope preset,
> - one wavelength (UV/Visible/Near-IR/Mid-IR/Radio),
> - one binary separation that is “marginal.”
>
> Record:
> - the resolution (arcsec),
> - the resolved/marginal/unresolved status,
> - one sentence explaining *why* (link to $\lambda$ and $D$, optionally atmosphere).

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Resolution (diffraction limit):** the smallest angular separation a telescope can distinguish.
> - **Aperture $D$:** bigger $D$ → better (smaller) diffraction limit.
> - **Wavelength $\lambda$:** longer $\lambda$ → worse (larger) diffraction limit.
> - **Seeing (atmosphere):** turbulence can blur images beyond the diffraction limit; AO can partially correct.
>
> **Key relationship (diffraction-limited scaling):**
>
> $$\theta \propto \frac{\lambda}{D}$$
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - Increasing $D$ should decrease the resolution number (better detail).
> - Increasing $\lambda$ should increase the resolution number (worse detail).
> - With “Include Atmosphere” on, the limit may stop improving unless AO is enabled.
