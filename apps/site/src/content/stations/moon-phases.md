*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: Moon Phases (6–8 minutes)**
> **Demo setup:** start at New → First Quarter → Full → Third Quarter.
> **Tip:** Click **Station Mode** to add key-phase rows and print/copy your table.
> **Advanced (optional):** Enable **Advanced: latitude/season** to estimate rise/set using latitude (deg) and day of year (1–365). Polar day/night returns N/A.
>
> **Your station artifact (fill in):**
> 1) **Control(s):** Moon angle $\alpha$
> 2) **Observable(s):** phase name, illumination fraction $f$, illuminated (%), days since new ($d$), waxing/waning
> 3) **Governing relationship:** write this equation in words:
>
>    $$f=\frac{1+\cos\alpha}{2}$$
> 4) **Sanity check:** what is $f$ at $\alpha=90^\circ$?
> 5) **Connection sentence:** "This matters for eclipses/totality because…"

## Data Collection Tasks (Station Mode)

1. Click **Station Mode** at the top of the demo. Add the four key phases using the preset buttons: **New**, **First Quarter**, **Full**, **Third Quarter**. Four rows appear in the table.

2. For each preset row, verify that the phase name, $\alpha$, $f$, and illuminated (%) match your expectations.

3. Now add **four custom angle rows** by dragging the Moon to approximately $\alpha = 45^\circ$, $135^\circ$, $225^\circ$, and $315^\circ$. Click **Add Row** for each. You should now have **8 rows**.

4. Look at your 8-row table. Describe in one sentence how $f$ changes as $\alpha$ increases from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$.

5. Click **Export** to copy the table, then paste it into your lab document.

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Phase:** the shape we see from Earth; it's the overlap of the Moon's lit half and the half facing Earth.
> - **Illumination fraction $f$ (0–1):** fraction of the visible disk that is lit (0 = New, 1 = Full).
> - **Illuminated (%)**: the same information as $f$, but scaled to 0–100.
> - **Days since new ($d$):** where we are in the 29.53-day cycle (0 at New, ~14.8 at Full).
> - **Moon angle $\alpha$ (degrees, this demo):** $0^\circ$ = Full, $180^\circ$ = New; quarter phases are at $90^\circ$ and $270^\circ$.
> - **Waxing:** the illuminated fraction is increasing (after New → toward Full).
> - **Waning:** the illuminated fraction is decreasing (after Full → toward New).
> - **Quarter phase:** about 50% illuminated; "quarter" refers to the orbit position, not the lit fraction.
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - First/Third Quarter should be about 50% illuminated.
> - New Moon is not "unlit" — the Sun still lights half the Moon; we're mostly seeing the dark half.
> - Full Moon should be about halfway through the cycle ($d \approx 14.8$ days since new).
> - Earth's shadow is not what causes phases (it matters only during eclipses, which are rare).
