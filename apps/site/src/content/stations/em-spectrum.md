*Goal:* Use the demo to make a claim supported by (1) at least one number/readout and (2) at least one sanity check.

> **Station card: EM Spectrum (6–8 minutes)**
> **Artifact:** a completed “spectrum card” for one band.
>
> 1) Choose (or you’re assigned) one band: Radio / IR / Visible / UV / X-ray / Gamma.  
> 2) Use the demo to record:
>    - one representative wavelength (with unit),
>    - the corresponding photon energy (with unit),
>    - one object example (Objects tab),
>    - one telescope/detector example (Telescopes tab).
> 3) Write one sentence:
>    - “This band is good for observing ____ because ____.”

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Wavelength $\lambda$:** “size” of the wave; longer $\lambda$ → lower photon energy.
> - **Photon energy:** energy per photon (not the same thing as brightness).
> - **Band names:** labels we give to wavelength ranges (radio → gamma).
>
> **Key relationship (photon energy scaling):**
>
> $$E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}$$
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - Ordering: Radio (lowest energy) → … → Gamma (highest energy).
> - Shorter wavelength should correspond to larger energy readouts.
> - Use convenient units: nm/$\\mu\\mathrm{m}$/mm/m for $\lambda$; eV/keV/MeV for energy.
