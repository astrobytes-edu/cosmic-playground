title: "Planetary Conjunctions — Starter"
audience: "ASTR 101 — Orbits & Sky Motion"
estimated_minutes: 25
demos:
  - slug: planetary-conjunctions
    required: true
    note: "Core: identify conjunctions and connect them to synodic period."
  - slug: keplers-laws
    required: false
    note: "Optional extension: tie conjunction frequency to orbital period."
overview: "A short sequence that builds intuition for conjunctions as a geometric + timing consequence of orbital motion."
instructions: |
  1) Before touching controls, write a one-sentence prediction: which pair will conjoin sooner, inner or outer planets?
  2) Do the required demo and record one piece of evidence.
  3) If time, do the optional demo to justify your explanation with orbital-period reasoning.
