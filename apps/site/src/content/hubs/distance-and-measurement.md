> **What this page is**
> This is the instructor-facing throughline for distance measurement: how a tiny angle becomes a distance (parallax), why parsecs are a measurement-defined unit, and why instrument precision sets what is directly measurable.

## The throughline (one sentence)

Distance is inferred, not seen: we use a **baseline + angle** to measure nearby distances (parallax), translate into convenient units (parsecs/light-years), and acknowledge that precision limits determine where we must switch methods.

## The connection map

1. **Parallax distance** establishes the geometric measurement: smaller parallax angle means greater distance, and the parsec is defined by $d(\text{pc}) = 1/p(\text{arcsec})$.

2. **Cosmic Distance Builder (activity)** helps students attach intuition to the numbers by comparing scales and converting units. (Optional but strongly recommended as reinforcement.)

## Recommended sequencing

- Use parallax first as the “anchor measurement.”
- Then use distance scaling/translation activities to build intuition for what those numbers mean.
