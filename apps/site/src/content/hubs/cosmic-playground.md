## The throughline (one sentence)

Astronomy is built on *geometry + light*: we infer reality by connecting **what we observe** (angles, brightness, time) to **a simple model** with explicit assumptions.

## The four-demos connection map

1. **Seasons** establishes: tilt changes the Sun’s declination, which changes day length and noon altitude. The transferable skill is reading *angles as physical constraints*.

2. **Moon phases** establishes: phases are geometry (illuminated half vs visible half), not shadows. The transferable skill is reading *phase angle → observable fraction*.

3. **Angular size** establishes: what you see depends on $d/D$. The transferable skill is reasoning with *ratios and units* (degrees/arcminutes/arcseconds).

4. **Eclipse geometry** synthesizes: eclipses require (i) correct phase and (ii) near-node geometry, and their appearance depends on angular size.

## Recommended sequencing

- **MW lecture moments:** one short exploration per day (prediction → run → explain).
- **Friday Astro Lab:** either (a) one demo deep dive, or (b) the rotation capstone across all four.

## Capstone
