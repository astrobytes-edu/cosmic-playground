> **What this page is**
> This is the instructor-facing throughline tying together three “light” demos into one measurement story: **what you observe (wavelength)**, **what it means (temperature/physics)**, and **what you can resolve (instrument limits)**.

## The throughline (one sentence)

Astronomy is constrained by *light and instruments*: we choose a **wavelength band**, use a **model** to interpret what that light implies, and accept that every inference is filtered by **resolution and detection limits**.

## The three-demos connection map

1. **EM spectrum** establishes the shared vocabulary: $\lambda$, $\nu$, and photon energy $E$, plus the idea that different bands require different detectors.

2. **Blackbody radiation** connects an observable spectrum shape (and peak wavelength) to a physical inference: temperature (and steep changes in emitted power with $T$).

3. **Telescope resolution** introduces the measurement constraint: even perfect optics cannot resolve arbitrarily fine detail; resolution depends on $\lambda$ and aperture.

## Recommended sequencing

- **MW lecture moments:** use EM spectrum first (vocabulary), then blackbody (interpretation), then telescope resolution (constraints).
- **Friday lab:** run the capstone rotation so students must use *all three* to make a defendable observing choice.

## Capstone
