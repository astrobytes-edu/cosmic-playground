## P0 (blocking / correctness / teachability)

- **Measurement-limit clarity:** add one explicit instructor note (and/or student microcopy) that “measurable” depends on precision and that the visualization is exaggerated for teaching.
- **Unit scaffolding:** add a tiny on-page “arcsec <-> mas <-> $\mu\mathrm{as}$” conversion reminder so students don’t treat unit changes as physics changes.
- **Assessment alignment:** package the clickers into a quick sequence that pairs each with a demo action (parallax slider, uncertainty slider, preset stars).

## P1 (important)

- **Noise + uncertainty:** add an optional “measurement noise” mode and repeated measurements to show how uncertainty averages down (matches README future ideas).
- **Baseline comparison:** add an Earth vs Jupiter (or spacecraft) baseline toggle to support the “bigger baseline” discussion question.
- **Proper motion:** consider a future extension combining proper motion with parallax (README future ideas), clearly separated as an advanced toggle.

## P2 (nice to have)

- **3D visualization:** add a depth/3D view to help students connect “angle” to geometry without relying only on the top-down diagram.
- **Catalog expansions:** expand the preset star catalog and include explicit “Gaia measurability” labels for more examples.
