## Clicker questions (with distractors + explanation)

### Clicker 1 — Direction of the relationship

**Demo setup:** open `/play/parallax-distance/` and increase distance on the slider.

**Question:** As distance increases, the parallax angle…

A. increases  
B. decreases  
C. stays the same  
D. changes sign randomly

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Parallax is inverse: $p \propto 1/d$.  
**Misconception targeted:** “Closer stars have smaller parallax.”

### Clicker 2 — Parsecs from parallax

**Demo setup:** any.

**Question:** A star with parallax $p = 0.1"$ has distance:

A. 0.1 pc  
B. 1 pc  
C. 10 pc  
D. 100 pc

**Correct:** C  
**Why:** $d(\text{pc}) = 1/p(\text{arcsec}) = 1/0.1 = 10$.  
**Misconception targeted:** inverse scaling confusion.

### Clicker 3 — What is the baseline?

**Demo setup:** click **Jan** and **July** and look at the top-down orbit.

**Question:** The demo’s six-month parallax measurement uses Earth at opposite sides of its orbit, which is a baseline of approximately:

A. 1 AU  
B. 2 AU  
C. 1 light-year  
D. 1 parsec

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** January ↔ July corresponds to opposite sides of Earth’s orbit, about 2 AU apart.  
**Misconception targeted:** confusing baseline and distance units.

### Clicker 4 — Which mission measures smaller angles?

**Demo setup:** toggle **Hipparcos** and **Gaia**.

**Question:** Which instrument can measure **smaller** parallax angles (higher precision)?

A. Hipparcos  
B. Gaia  
C. They are the same  
D. Neither can measure parallax

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Gaia is designed for much finer astrometry than Hipparcos (the demo’s precision toggle illustrates this).  
**Misconception targeted:** “Modern instruments don’t fundamentally change what’s measurable.”

### Clicker 5 — Is parallax a property of the star?

**Demo setup:** none.

**Question:** Which statement is most accurate?

A. Parallax is a physical property of the star.  
B. Parallax depends on the observer’s baseline and the star’s distance.  
C. Parallax depends on the star’s temperature.  
D. Parallax is caused by the star moving in space.

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Parallax is geometric (baseline + distance).  
**Misconception targeted:** “Parallax is a property of the star.”

### Clicker 6 — Bigger baseline thought experiment

**Demo setup:** none.

**Question:** If we could observe a star from a **larger baseline** than Earth’s orbit (e.g., from farther out in the Solar System), then the measured parallax angle would:

A. get smaller (harder to measure)  
B. get larger (easier to measure)  
C. stay the same  
D. become negative

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** A larger baseline produces a larger apparent shift for the same distance.  
**Misconception targeted:** “Better measurement is only about better cameras, not geometry.”

## Short-answer prompts

1. Explain why measuring stellar parallax was historically difficult (what had to be measured, and how small it is).
2. In your own words, define a parsec and explain why astronomers like it.
3. Using the demo, describe how the star’s apparent position changes from January to July.
4. Why can’t parallax be the only distance method for the whole Milky Way?

## Exit ticket (3 questions)

1. What happens to parallax when distance increases? (One sentence.)
2. A star has $p = 0.5"$. What is its distance in pc? (One number.)
3. Name one factor that limits parallax measurements.
