> Each item includes a **demo setup** so you can reproduce the scenario live, plus distractors tied to common misconceptions.

## Clicker questions

> **Clicker 1: Distance scaling**
> **Prompt:** If an object moves twice as far away but stays the same physical size, its angular size will…
>
> A. double  
> B. halve  
> C. stay the same  
> D. become zero instantly
>
> **Correct:** B.
>
> **Reasoning:** For small angles, $\theta \propto D/d$.
>
> **Demo setup:** Pick any preset, then double the distance slider and watch the angular size update.

> **Clicker 2: Pick the right unit**
> **Prompt:** Which unit is usually most appropriate for the angular size of the full Moon?
>
> A. arcseconds  
> B. arcminutes  
> C. degrees  
> D. radians
>
> **Correct:** C (about half a degree).
>
> **Demo setup:** Select **Moon (Today)** and read the unit that the demo displays.

> **Clicker 3: Why total eclipses are possible**
> **Prompt:** Why can the Moon sometimes completely cover the Sun during a solar eclipse?
>
> A. The Moon is physically larger than the Sun  
> B. The Moon is closer, so it can have a similar angular size to the Sun  
> C. The Sun turns off during eclipses  
> D. Earth’s shadow blocks the Sun
>
> **Correct:** B.
>
> **Demo setup:** Compare **Sun** and **Moon (Today)** presets and show their angular sizes are similar.

## Short answer

> **Short answer 1: Read the equation like a sentence**
> **Prompt (2–3 sentences):** The demo uses $\theta = 2\arctan(D/2d)$. Explain what this equation is saying in words, including what happens when you increase $D$ or increase $d$.
>
> **Answer key (core idea):** Angular size depends on the ratio of physical diameter to distance. Increasing $D$ increases $\theta$; increasing $d$ decreases $\theta$. For small angles, it behaves like $\theta \approx D/d$ (in radians).

> **Short answer 2: Quick mental math (small-angle)**
> **Prompt:** A 2 m tall person stands 20 m away. Use $\theta \approx D/d$ to estimate the angular size in radians and degrees.
>
> **Answer key:** $\theta \approx 2/20 = 0.1$ rad. In degrees, $0.1\times(180/\pi)\approx 5.7^\circ$.
>
> **Sanity check:** At 20 m, a person looks “several degrees” tall — consistent with everyday experience.

## Exit ticket (1 minute)

> **Exit ticket: Totality condition (conceptual)**
> **Prompt:** Write the condition for a **total solar eclipse** in angular-size language (no calculations required).
>
> **Expected:** The Moon’s angular diameter must be at least as large as the Sun’s angular diameter ($\theta_{\text{Moon}} \gtrsim \theta_{\text{Sun}}$), *and* the alignment must be right (from the eclipse geometry demo).
