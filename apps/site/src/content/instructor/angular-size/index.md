## Why this demo exists

> **Why This Matters**
> Angular size is one of the most transferable “astronomy math” ideas: what you *see* depends on physical size and distance. This single relationship explains why the Moon and Sun look similar in size, why planets look like points to the naked eye, and why telescopes have a resolution limit.

## Learning goals (ASTR 101)

Students should be able to:

- Predict how angular size changes when **distance** or **physical size** changes (inverse proportional reasoning).
- Read and compare angular sizes in **degrees**, **arcminutes**, and **arcseconds**.
- Explain the coincidence: Sun and Moon have similar angular diameters, enabling total solar eclipses (with the eclipse demo as the follow-up).

## 10–15 minute live-teach script (projector)

1. Start with **Sun** preset. Ask: *“What does $0.5^\\circ$ look like?”* Connect to the “thumb at arm’s length” reference if you use it.

2. Switch to **Moon (Today)**. Ask: *“Does the Moon’s angular size feel ‘about the same’ as the Sun?”* Point out the similarity.

3. Use **Moon time mode: Orbit**. Slide through orbit angle and show the angular size range changing slightly (perigee vs apogee).

4. Switch to **Moon time mode: Recession time**. Ask: *“If the Moon slowly moves away, what happens to its angular size?”* Tie to the eclipse consequence: total eclipses cannot last forever.

5. Switch to everyday objects (quarter/thumb/ISS). Ask: *“Which unit makes the most sense here: degrees, arcminutes, or arcseconds?”*

## Suggested connections to the other demos

- **Eclipse geometry:** total solar eclipses require alignment *and* comparable angular sizes of Sun and Moon.
- **Moon phases:** phases change over the synodic month; angular size does not define phase, but it matters for eclipse appearance.
- **Seasons:** a cautionary parallel — “what we see” can mislead unless we connect it to a model.
