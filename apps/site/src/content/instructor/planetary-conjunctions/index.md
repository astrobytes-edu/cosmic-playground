- Student demo: [Play `planetary-conjunctions`](../../play/planetary-conjunctions/)
- Exhibit page: [Read/assign the exhibit](../../exhibits/planetary-conjunctions/)
- Teaching hook: have students predict **which planet pairs can conjoin**, then use the demo to connect conjunctions to **relative orbital motion** (synodic period) and **inclination** (why most conjunctions aren’t eclipses).
