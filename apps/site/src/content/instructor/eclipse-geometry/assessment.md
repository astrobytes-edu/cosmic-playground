## Clicker questions

> **Clicker 1: Which phase for which eclipse?**
> **Prompt:** A **solar eclipse** can only happen at…
>
> A. New Moon  
> B. Full Moon  
> C. First Quarter  
> D. Third Quarter
>
> **Correct:** A.
>
> **Reasoning:** The Moon must be between Earth and the Sun (conjunction).
>
> **Demo setup:** Click **New Moon** and show that solar eclipse checks occur at New; click **Full Moon** and show lunar eclipse checks occur at Full.

> **Clicker 2: Why not every month?**
> **Prompt:** If New Moon happens every ~29.5 days, why don’t we get a solar eclipse every month?
>
> A. The Moon’s orbit is tilted, so it usually passes above/below the Sun  
> B. The Sun turns off during most new moons  
> C. The Moon stops orbiting during some months  
> D. Earth’s seasons block eclipses
>
> **Correct:** A.
>
> **Demo setup:** Click **New Moon**, then drag the node line so the Moon is far from the ecliptic; show “NO ECLIPSE.”

> **Clicker 3: Nodes matter because…**
> **Prompt:** A “node” is important for eclipses because it is where…
>
> A. The Moon is closest to Earth  
> B. The Moon crosses the ecliptic plane  
> C. The Moon is half illuminated  
> D. The Moon’s crater density is highest
>
> **Correct:** B.
>
> **Demo setup:** Point at the ascending/descending node markers and the “Nearest node” readout.

## Short answer

> **Short answer 1: The two-condition explanation**
> **Prompt (2–3 sentences):** Explain why eclipses require two conditions. Your answer must mention **phase** and **node proximity**.
>
> **Answer key (core idea):** A solar eclipse requires New Moon (Moon between Earth and Sun) and a lunar eclipse requires Full Moon (Earth between Sun and Moon), but phase alone is not sufficient. Because the Moon’s orbit is tilted, the Moon is usually above or below the ecliptic plane; an eclipse only happens when the Moon is near a node (close to the plane) at syzygy.

> **Short answer 2: Quick estimate with the tilt model**
> **Prompt:** Using the small-angle intuition $\beta \approx i\sin(\Delta\lambda)$, estimate how far from the ecliptic plane the Moon is if $i=5.145^\circ$ and it is $\Delta\lambda=10^\circ$ from a node.
>
> **Answer key:** $\sin 10^\circ \approx 0.17$, so $\beta \approx 5.145^\circ \times 0.17 \approx 0.9^\circ$ (order of magnitude).
>
> **Sanity check:** This is “about a degree,” which is the right scale for eclipse windows.

## Exit ticket (1 minute)

> **Exit ticket: Define ‘eclipse season’**
> **Prompt:** In one sentence, what is an “eclipse season”?
>
> **Expected:** A time interval when the Sun is near one of the Moon’s nodes, so New/Full Moons during that interval are likely to produce eclipses.
