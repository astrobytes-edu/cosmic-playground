## P0 (blocking / correctness / teachability)

- **Optional compare UX:** decide whether to add an explicit compare overlay beyond the current workflow (Station mode rows / copy-results comparisons).
- **Instructor usability:** add a one-page “teach script + misconceptions + one key question” printable summary linked from the instructor guide.
- **CMB storyline (optional):** decide whether CMB presets are in-scope for ASTR 101 and, if so, add a short instructor-note section on how/when to use them.

## P1 (important)

- **Stefan–Boltzmann intuition:** add an “area under the curve” visualization toggle (matches README future ideas) to make $T^4$ scaling more visceral.
- **Approximations clarity:** keep “temperature → color” language explicitly perceptual/approximate (see `packages/physics/src/blackbodyRadiationModel.ts` notes).
- **Answer keys:** add suggested “ideal student responses” to the activities protocols to reduce TA variability.

## P2 (nice to have)

- **Model extensions (from README ideas):** Wien/Rayleigh-Jeans/Wien approximations overlay; real stellar spectra comparison (absorption lines); HR-diagram connection.
- **Practice mode:** lightweight “guess the temperature from the curve” quiz mode.
