## Clicker questions (with distractors + explanation)

### Clicker 1 — Which is hotter?

**Demo setup:** open `/play/blackbody-radiation/` and compare presets **Red Giant** and **B**.

**Question:** Which object is hotter?

A. Red Giant  
B. B star  
C. Same temperature  
D. You can’t tell from the spectrum

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Hotter blackbodies peak at shorter wavelengths and the temperature readout confirms the preset ordering.  
**Misconception targeted:** “Red means hot.”

### Clicker 2 — Peak shift (Wien scaling)

**Demo setup:** start at Sun; then increase temperature.

**Question:** As temperature increases, the peak wavelength $\lambda_{\text{peak}}$…

A. shifts to longer wavelength (redder)  
B. shifts to shorter wavelength (bluer)  
C. stays fixed  
D. disappears

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Wien’s law: $\lambda_{\text{peak}} \propto 1/T$.  
**Misconception targeted:** confusing “red hot” everyday intuition.

### Clicker 3 — Total power scaling (qualitative)

**Demo setup:** compare two temperatures (any two distinct settings).

**Question:** If a star’s temperature increases (same size), its emitted power per unit area…

A. decreases  
B. increases slowly (roughly linear in $T$)  
C. increases very steeply (roughly like $T^4$)  
D. stays the same

**Correct:** C  
**Why:** Stefan–Boltzmann scaling $F \propto T^4$ (the curve’s overall “area” grows rapidly).  
**Misconception targeted:** underestimating temperature’s impact on luminosity.

### Clicker 4 — Visible vs infrared detectability

**Demo setup:** set temperature to a low value using the log scale (or use a cool preset like **Today** in the CMB section).

**Question:** A very cool object’s blackbody peak is most likely in:

A. X-ray  
B. Visible  
C. Infrared / microwave  
D. Ultraviolet

**Correct:** C  
**Why:** Cooler → longer peak wavelength. The demo shows cool spectra peaking outside visible.  
**Misconception targeted:** “If we can’t see it with eyes, it isn’t emitting.”

### Clicker 5 — The Sun’s “color”

**Demo setup:** select **Sun**.

**Question:** Which statement best matches the model?

A. The Sun emits only yellow light.  
B. The Sun peaks in the visible and emits across the whole visible band, so from space it appears close to white.  
C. The Sun is red because it’s cooler than other stars.  
D. Color is unrelated to temperature.

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** The spectrum is broad across visible even if there is a peak; the demo’s insight text and curve support this.  
**Misconception targeted:** “The Sun is yellow” as a hard physical statement.

### Clicker 6 — What does “blackbody” mean here?

**Demo setup:** none.

**Question:** In this demo, treating a star as a blackbody means:

A. It emits no light.  
B. Its emitted spectrum depends mainly on temperature, even though real stars also show spectral lines.  
C. It absorbs no light.  
D. Only black-colored objects behave this way.

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Blackbody is an idealized thermal emitter model; it’s a useful first approximation.  
**Misconception targeted:** literal interpretation of the word “black.”

## Short-answer prompts

1. Explain why “red hot” is a misleading phrase for stars.
2. Using the demo, describe two ways the spectrum changes when temperature increases.
3. Why might an infrared telescope be better than a visible telescope for finding cool objects (brown dwarfs, dust)?
4. In one paragraph: how does blackbody radiation support the idea that astronomy infers physical properties from light?

## Exit ticket (3 questions)

1. Hotter objects peak at (shorter/longer) wavelengths.
2. If temperature doubles, does total emitted power per unit area increase by about 2×, 4×, 8×, or 16×?
3. Name one common misconception about star color and temperature.
