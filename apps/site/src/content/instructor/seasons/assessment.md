## Clicker questions

> **Clicker 1: If distance caused seasons…**
> **Prompt:** Earth is closest to the Sun in early January. If seasons were mainly caused by distance to the Sun, what would we expect to be true?
>
> A. Both hemispheres should have summer at the same time  
> B. The Northern Hemisphere should have summer in January  
> C. Seasons should be opposite in the two hemispheres *(what we actually observe)*  
> D. Day length should not change during the year
>
> **Correct:** A (and B would follow for the Northern Hemisphere).
>
> **Reasoning:** Distance-to-Sun is a global property; it cannot make one hemisphere hotter while the other is colder.
>
> **Distractors to listen for:**
> - C: students describing the real world but not explaining the causal logic.
> - D: confusion between “distance causes seasons” and “tilt causes day length changes.”
>
> **Demo setup:** Use defaults → click **June Solstice** and **December Solstice**; point to the North/South season labels and the Earth–Sun distance readout.

> **Clicker 2: What happens if tilt = $0^\\circ$?**
> **Prompt:** In the seasons demo, set axial tilt to $0^\circ$. What happens?
>
> A. Seasons get stronger  
> B. Seasons disappear (every day is like an equinox)  
> C. Day length becomes 24 hours everywhere  
> D. Earth becomes closest to the Sun in July
>
> **Correct:** B.
>
> **Reasoning:** With $\varepsilon=0^\circ$, the declination stays $\delta=0^\circ$ all year, so the seasonal geometry vanishes.
>
> **Demo setup:** Set **Axial Tilt = $0^\\circ$** → click through the four season presets and watch day length/noon altitude stop changing.

> **Clicker 3: Noon Sun altitude (qualitative)**
> **Prompt:** At latitude $40^\circ$N, when is the noon Sun highest in the sky?
>
> A. March equinox  
> B. June solstice  
> C. September equinox  
> D. December solstice
>
> **Correct:** B.
>
> **Reasoning:** The Sun’s declination is most positive at the June solstice, so $|\phi-\delta|$ is smallest and the noon altitude is largest.
>
> **Demo setup:** Set latitude to **$40^\\circ$N** → click **March equinox** and **June solstice** and compare the Sun Altitude readout.

## Short answer

> **Short answer 1: Opposite hemispheres**
> **Prompt (2–3 sentences):** Explain why the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have opposite seasons. Your explanation must mention **day length** and/or **noon Sun altitude** (not distance).
>
> **Answer key (core idea):** Earth’s tilt changes the Sun’s declination through the year. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it has longer days and a higher noon Sun (more direct sunlight), while the Southern Hemisphere simultaneously has shorter days and a lower noon Sun, and vice versa.

> **Short answer 2: A quick calculation (noon altitude)**
> **Prompt:** Use the model formula $h_\odot = 90^\circ - |\phi-\delta|$. At latitude $\phi=40^\circ$N:
>
> 1) What is $h_\odot$ on an equinox ($\delta=0^\circ$)?  
> 2) What is $h_\odot$ on the June solstice ($\delta\approx +23.5^\circ$)?
>
> **Answer key:**
> 1) $h_\odot = 90^\circ - |40^\circ-0^\circ| = 50^\circ$  
> 2) $h_\odot = 90^\circ - |40^\circ-23.5^\circ| = 73.5^\circ$
>
> **Sanity check:** June should be higher than the equinox at northern mid-latitudes.

## Exit ticket (1 minute)

> **Exit ticket: The seasons sentence**
> **Prompt:** Fill in the blanks: “Seasons happen mainly because Earth’s **_____** changes the Sun’s **_____**, which changes **_____** and **_____**.”
>
> **Expected:** tilt/obliquity; declination; day length; noon altitude (or “directness of sunlight”).
