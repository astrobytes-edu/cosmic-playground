## Clicker questions

> **Clicker 1: Fastest at perihelion or aphelion?**
> **Prompt:** In an elliptical orbit around a star, the planet’s speed is greatest at…
>
> A. Perihelion  
> B. Aphelion  
> C. It’s the same everywhere  
> D. It depends only on the star’s mass, not position
>
> **Correct:** A.
>
> **Reasoning:** Kepler’s 2nd law (equal areas in equal times) forces higher speed at smaller $r$.
>
> **Demo setup:** Use a high‑$e$ orbit, then use the time slider (or Animate) to compare the speed readout near perihelion vs aphelion.

> **Clicker 2: Kepler 3 scaling**
> **Prompt:** If you increase the semi-major axis by a factor of 4 (same star mass), the period increases by a factor of…
>
> A. 2  
> B. 4  
> C. 8  
> D. 16
>
> **Correct:** C.
>
> **Reasoning:** $P \propto a^{3/2}$, so $P$ scales as $4^{3/2}=8$.
>
> **Demo setup:** Set $M=1$, compare $P$ at $a=1$ and $a=4$.

> **Clicker 3: Velocity vector direction**
> **Prompt:** When the velocity vector overlay is enabled, the velocity vector points…
>
> A. Toward the star  
> B. Away from the star  
> C. Tangent to the orbit (direction of motion)  
> D. In a fixed direction regardless of position
>
> **Correct:** C.
>
> **Demo setup:** Enable “Show velocity vector”, then move time around the orbit and note the vector is tangent to the path.

## Short answer

> **Short answer 1: The ‘two pictures’ explanation**
> **Prompt (3–5 sentences):** Explain how Newton’s inverse-square gravity connects to Kepler’s laws. Your answer must mention both (i) a force pointing toward the star and (ii) a change in orbital speed with distance.
>
> **Answer key (core idea):** Gravity provides a central force toward the star, which implies conservation of angular momentum and a constant areal sweep rate (Kepler 2). That forces the planet to move faster when it is closer (perihelion) and slower when it is farther (aphelion). The same gravitational law also yields the period–distance scaling (Kepler 3).

> **Short answer 2: Units discipline**
> **Prompt:** The demo reports orbital distance in AU and speed in km/s. Explain (in 1–2 sentences) what it would mean to “change units” without changing the physics.
>
> **Expected:** Units are a measurement/labeling convention; the underlying relationship is unchanged and the numbers transform by fixed conversion factors.

## Exit ticket (1 minute)

> **Exit ticket: One-sentence Kepler 2**
> **Prompt:** In one sentence, state Kepler’s 2nd law in your own words.
>
> **Expected:** A line from the star to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
