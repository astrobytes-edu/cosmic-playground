## Clicker questions (with distractors + explanation)

### Clicker 1 — What changes when wavelength increases?

**Demo setup:** open `/play/em-spectrum/`, start in **Visible**.

**Question:** If you move the slider to a **longer wavelength**, what happens to **frequency** and **photon energy**?

A. Frequency increases; photon energy increases  
B. Frequency increases; photon energy decreases  
C. Frequency decreases; photon energy decreases  
D. Frequency stays the same; photon energy stays the same

**Correct:** C  
**Why:** The demo encodes $c=\lambda\nu$ (so longer $\lambda$ means smaller $\nu$) and $E=h\nu$ (so smaller $\nu$ means smaller $E$).  
**Misconception targeted:** “Energy depends on wavelength in the opposite way.”

### Clicker 2 — Red vs blue photon

**Demo setup:** stay in **Visible**; compare a red-end wavelength vs a blue/violet-end wavelength.

**Question:** Which choice corresponds to **higher photon energy**?

A. Red end of visible  
B. Blue/violet end of visible  
C. They are equal energy  
D. It depends on brightness, not wavelength

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Shorter wavelength ↔ higher frequency ↔ higher photon energy.  
**Misconception targeted:** “Red is more energetic because it ‘feels hotter’ in everyday contexts.”

### Clicker 3 — Same physics across categories

**Demo setup:** click **Radio**, then click **X-ray**.

**Question:** Which statement is most accurate?

A. Radio and X-rays are fundamentally different phenomena (not both “light”).  
B. They are the same physics; they differ mainly in wavelength/frequency/energy.  
C. Radio is sound waves; X-rays are light waves.  
D. X-rays travel faster than radio waves.

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** They are both electromagnetic radiation; $c$ is the same in vacuum. Categories are teaching conventions.  
**Misconception targeted:** “Radio is sound / different kind of wave.”

### Clicker 4 — Where is the CMB?

**Demo setup:** open the **Objects** tab and click the object labeled **CMB** (if visible). Alternatively, click **Microwave** and note the wavelength scale.

**Question:** The Cosmic Microwave Background is primarily observed in which band?

A. Visible  
B. Ultraviolet  
C. Microwave  
D. Gamma-ray

**Correct:** C  
**Why:** The CMB’s peak today is in the microwave band (the demo’s object card and wavelength range support this).  
**Misconception targeted:** “Most important astronomy is in visible light.”

### Clicker 5 — Choosing a telescope for a wavelength

**Demo setup:** pick a wavelength around **10 µm** (Mid-IR scale) and then open the **Telescopes** tab.

**Question:** Which telescope is designed for infrared observations?

A. Chandra  
B. JWST  
C. Fermi  
D. (Trick) Any telescope works equally well

**Correct:** B  
**Why:** Different detectors are built for different bands; the demo’s telescope cards list their wavelength ranges.  
**Misconception targeted:** “A telescope is a telescope; wavelength doesn’t matter.”

### Clicker 6 — Photon energy vs “brightness”

**Demo setup:** compare **Radio** vs **Gamma**.

**Question:** Which statement is correct?

A. Radio sources are always dim because radio photons are low-energy.  
B. Gamma-ray sources are always bright because gamma photons are high-energy.  
C. Photon energy and brightness are different; a source can be bright in radio with many low-energy photons.  
D. Brightness depends only on wavelength.

**Correct:** C  
**Why:** Photon energy is per photon ($E=h\nu$). Brightness also depends on how many photons arrive and how they are distributed in time/space.  
**Misconception targeted:** “High-energy photons automatically mean brighter sources.”

## Short-answer prompts

1. In one paragraph: explain why we need space telescopes for UV/X-ray/gamma astronomy but can do much of radio astronomy from the ground.
2. Describe the difference between “higher-energy photons” and “brighter light” using an example from the demo.
3. The visible band is narrow. What does that imply about what our eyes can and cannot tell us about the Universe?
4. Choose one object from the demo’s **Objects** tab and explain why it is best observed in the band(s) listed.

## Exit ticket (3 questions)

1. If wavelength increases, what happens to frequency? (One sentence.)
2. Which has higher photon energy: infrared or ultraviolet? (One sentence.)
3. Name one reason astronomers build different telescopes for different wavelength bands.
