## MW Quick (3–5 min)

**Type:** Demo-driven  
**Goal:** Force “longer wavelength → lower energy” to become a *prediction*, not a memorized phrase.

1. Open the student demo: `/play/em-spectrum/`
2. Click **Visible**. Then use the slider to choose:
   - a wavelength near the **red** end of visible, and
   - a wavelength near the **blue/violet** end of visible.
3. **Prediction prompt (10–20 s):** *“Which choice should have higher photon energy?”*
4. Reveal by reading the **Energy** value for both. Name the relationship out loud: shorter wavelength → higher photon energy.
5. **One-sentence debrief:** “Energy per photon is not brightness; it’s ‘how energetic each photon is.’”

## MW Short (8–12 min)

**Type:** Demo-driven (pairs)  
**Goal:** Connect band names to wavelength scale and measurement constraints (detectors/telescopes).

**Student task (pairs):** Complete the “band map” table (one row per band).

| Band | One representative wavelength (with unit) | One representative photon energy (with unit) | One thing we can see in this band | One detector/telescope example |
|------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Radio |  |  |  |  |
| Infrared |  |  |  |  |
| Visible |  |  |  |  |
| X-ray or Gamma |  |  |  |  |

**Instructions:**
1. Use the band labels (Radio/IR/Visible/UV/X-ray/Gamma) to jump around.
2. Use the unit dropdowns to express:
   - wavelength in a convenient unit (nm, µm, mm, m),
   - energy in eV/keV/MeV as appropriate.
3. Use the **Telescopes** tab and **Objects** tab to collect one example per band.

**Synthesis prompt (2 minutes):** *“What changes across the spectrum: the physics, or our measurement tools?”*  
Expected: physics is continuous; our **detectors** and atmosphere constraints differ by band.

## Friday Lab (20–30+ min)

**Type:** Demo-driven investigation (small groups)  
**Goal:** Practice Observable → Model → Inference by choosing the right band for a science question and defending it with evidence.

### Setup (2–3 min)
- Each group picks (or is assigned) one science question:
  - Find **cold dust** in a star-forming region.
  - Detect **hot plasma** around a black hole / in a galaxy cluster.
  - Map **neutral hydrogen gas** in a galaxy.
  - See through **dust** to reveal protostars.

### Investigation (15–20 min)
For your question:
1. Use the demo to identify the best band(s) (you may choose more than one).
2. Gather **evidence** from the demo:
   - the band’s wavelength/energy scale (readouts),
   - an example object in that band (Objects tab),
   - an example telescope/detector (Telescopes tab).
3. Write a **claim–evidence–reasoning** paragraph:
   - Claim: “We should observe in ____ because …”
   - Evidence: numbers from the demo + object/telescope examples
   - Reasoning: connect the band to the physical conditions you want to probe

### Share-out (5 min)
Each group gives a 60-second pitch: band choice + one key piece of evidence + one limitation (e.g., “needs space telescope”).

## Station version (6–8 min)

> **Station card: EM Spectrum (6–8 minutes)**
> **Artifact:** a completed “spectrum card” for one band.
>
> 1) Choose (or you’re assigned) one band: Radio / IR / Visible / UV / X-ray / Gamma.  
> 2) Use the demo to record:
>    - one representative wavelength (with unit),
>    - the corresponding photon energy (with unit),
>    - one object example (Objects tab),
>    - one telescope/detector example (Telescopes tab).
> 3) Write one sentence:
>    - “This band is good for observing ____ because ____.”

> **Word bank + sanity checks**
> **Word bank:**
> - **Wavelength $\lambda$:** “size” of the wave; longer $\lambda$ → lower photon energy.
> - **Photon energy:** energy per photon (not the same thing as brightness).
> - **Band names:** labels we give to wavelength ranges (radio → gamma).
>
> **Key relationship (photon energy scaling):**
>
> $$E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}$$
>
> **Sanity checks:**
> - Ordering: Radio (lowest energy) → … → Gamma (highest energy).
> - Shorter wavelength should correspond to larger energy readouts.
> - Use convenient units: nm/µm/mm/m for $\lambda$; eV/keV/MeV for energy.
