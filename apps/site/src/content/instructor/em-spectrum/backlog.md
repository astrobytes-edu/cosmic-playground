## P0 (blocking / correctness / teachability)

- **Docs correctness:** verify the student-facing `demos/em-spectrum/README.md` matches the current UI (Objects/Telescopes panels, unit dropdowns) and update any mismatches.
- **Classroom reliability:** add a short “if the tab grids don’t load” troubleshooting note (likely data load order) to the instructor guide.
- **Assessment alignment:** convert the 6 clickers into a one-page “rapid clicker sequence” (setup → ask → reveal) for live use.

## P1 (important)

- **Atmosphere constraint story:** add an optional mini-section explaining why some bands need space-based observatories (tie to the telescope cards).
- **Band boundary clarity:** add a small “boundaries are conventions” callout in the student demo (or README) so students don’t treat categories as different physics.
- **More object/telescope exemplars:** consider expanding `demos/em-spectrum/object-data.js` and `demos/em-spectrum/telescope-data.js` (if needed) to better cover course-relevant examples.

## P2 (nice to have)

- **Visualization upgrades (from README ideas):** wavelength/frequency wave animation; log vs linear scale toggle; atmospheric transmission overlay.
- **Learning mode:** “quiz mode” for band identification and unit-conversion practice.
