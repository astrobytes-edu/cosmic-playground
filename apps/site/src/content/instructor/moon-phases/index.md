## Why this demo exists

> **Why This Matters**
> The most persistent misconception is that phases are caused by Earth’s shadow. This demo makes the geometry unavoidable: the Sun always lights half the Moon, and the phase we see depends on the viewing angle from Earth. Earth’s shadow only matters during eclipses.

## Learning goals (ASTR 101)

Students should be able to:

- Explain phases as a **viewing-geometry** effect (illuminated half vs visible half), not a shadow effect.
- Identify the phase at four key configurations (New, First Quarter, Full, Third Quarter) and relate “quarter” to orbit position.
- Use the demo’s readouts (illumination %, days since new) to connect phase to the synodic month.

## 10–15 minute live-teach script (projector)

1. Start at **Full Moon** (reset). Ask: *“What fraction of the Moon’s disk should be illuminated from Earth right now?”* Confirm the illumination readout is ~100%.

2. Drag the Moon to **New Moon**. Ask: *“Is the Moon ‘unlit’?”* Emphasize that it is still half lit — we just see the dark half.

3. Go to **First Quarter** and **Third Quarter**. Ask: *“Why is ‘quarter’ not 25% illuminated?”* Tie it to being one quarter / three quarters of the way through the orbit from New Moon.

4. Turn on the optional “Earth’s shadow” insight (if shown) and ask: *“Does the shadow touch the Moon most of the month?”* Use this to explicitly rule out the shadow misconception.

## Suggested connections to the other demos

- **Eclipse geometry:** eclipses require New/Full Moon *and* near-node geometry (phases alone are not eclipses).
- **Angular size:** the Sun and Moon have similar angular sizes, which is why total solar eclipses are possible.
- **Seasons:** tilt changes the Sun’s path in the sky; phases change because the Moon’s position changes relative to the Sun.
