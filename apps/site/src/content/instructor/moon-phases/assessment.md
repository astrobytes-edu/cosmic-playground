> Each item includes a **demo setup** so you can reproduce the scenario live, plus distractors tied to common misconceptions.

## Clicker questions

> **Clicker 1: What causes phases?**
> **Prompt:** What is the main cause of Moon phases?
>
> A. Earth’s shadow falling on the Moon  
> B. The Moon’s distance changing during the month  
> C. The angle between the Sun, Earth, and Moon (viewing geometry)  
> D. Clouds in Earth’s atmosphere blocking moonlight
>
> **Correct:** C.
>
> **Reasoning:** The Sun always illuminates half of the Moon. We see different fractions of that lit half depending on geometry.
>
> **Distractors to listen for:**
> - A: the classic misconception (confusing phases with eclipses)
> - B: mixing up brightness/size with phase
>
> **Demo setup:** Drag through several phases while keeping the “Sunlight comes from the left” story constant. Emphasize that the lit hemisphere is always the Sun-facing half.

> **Clicker 2: ‘Quarter’ means…**
> **Prompt:** “First Quarter” is called “quarter” because…
>
> A. We see 25% of the Moon illuminated  
> B. The Moon is 1/4 of the way through its orbit from New Moon  
> C. The Moon is 1/4 the size of Earth  
> D. The Moon’s shadow covers 1/4 of Earth
>
> **Correct:** B.
>
> **Demo setup:** Jump to **New Moon** then **First Quarter**; point at the orbit position and the illumination readout (~50%).

> **Clicker 3: New Moon is not ‘unlit’**
> **Prompt:** At New Moon, which statement is true?
>
> A. The Moon receives no sunlight  
> B. The Moon’s near side is dark, but the far side is illuminated  
> C. The Moon is inside Earth’s shadow for the whole day  
> D. The Moon is closer to Earth than at Full Moon
>
> **Correct:** B.
>
> **Reasoning:** The Sun still illuminates half the Moon; we just face the dark half at New Moon.
>
> **Demo setup:** Set to **New Moon** and ask students to point to which half faces the Sun.

## Short answer

> **Short answer 1: Two halves story**
> **Prompt (2–3 sentences):** Explain phases using the ideas “illuminated half” and “visible half.” Your explanation must state why the lit half does not change.
>
> **Answer key (core idea):** The Sun always lights half of the Moon. From Earth we see some fraction of that lit half depending on the Moon’s position relative to the Sun. The phase is the overlap of (1) the half that is illuminated and (2) the half that faces Earth.

> **Short answer 2: A quick calculation**
> **Prompt:** The demo uses $f=\frac{1+\cos\alpha}{2}$ for illumination fraction. If $\alpha=60^\circ$, what is $f$?
>
> **Answer key:** $\cos 60^\circ = 0.5$, so $f=\frac{1+0.5}{2}=0.75$ (75%).
>
> **Sanity check:** $60^\circ$ is closer to Full ($0^\circ$) than to Quarter ($90^\circ$), so it should be more than 50% illuminated.

## Exit ticket (1 minute)

> **Exit ticket: Eclipse connection**
> **Prompt:** During which phase can a **lunar eclipse** happen (in principle)?
>
> **Expected:** Full Moon (because Earth must be between the Sun and the Moon).
