title: "Planetary Conjunctions: Alignments in the Sky"
status: draft
levels: [ASTR101]
topics: [EarthSky, Orbits]
time_minutes: 8
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["conjunctions", "opposition", "synodic period", "relative motion"]
learning_goals:
  - "Define conjunction and opposition as seen from Earth."
  - "Explain why conjunctions repeat using Earth’s motion relative to another planet."
  - "Use the model to estimate the time between successive conjunctions (synodic period)."
misconceptions:
  - "A conjunction means the planets are physically close together in space."
predict_prompt: "When Earth and a planet line up (a conjunction), will that planet stay near the Sun in our sky for long? Why or why not?"
play_steps:
  - "Advance time to find a conjunction and an opposition."
  - "Compare where the planet is in space to how close it appears to the Sun in the sky."
  - "Measure the time between two conjunctions and describe the pattern you see."
explain_prompt: "Use relative motion to explain why the time between conjunctions is different from a planet’s orbital period."
model_notes:
  - "The model is schematic (not to scale) and focuses on geometry and timing rather than precise ephemerides."

Explore how conjunctions and oppositions are line-of-sight alignments caused by relative motion, and estimate how long it takes for the same alignment to repeat.
