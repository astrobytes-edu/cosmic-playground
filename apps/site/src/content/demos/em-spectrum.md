title: "Electromagnetic Spectrum: Light Beyond Visible"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [LightSpectra]
time_minutes: 10
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["wavelength", "frequency", "spectrum"]
learning_goals:
  - "Order EM bands by wavelength and frequency."
  - "Connect wavelength to what kinds of detectors/observations are needed."
  - "Explain why different bands reveal different physical processes."
misconceptions:
  - "All telescopes see the same thing; only magnification changes."
predict_prompt: "If you switch from visible to infrared observations, what kinds of objects or features might become easier to detect?"
play_steps:
  - "Compare bands and note the wavelength/frequency scale."
  - "Identify at least two real-world sources or uses for different bands."
  - "Match bands to a type of astronomical observation."
explain_prompt: "Explain how wavelength choice changes what information you can extract from an object."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
