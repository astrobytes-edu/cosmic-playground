title: "Electromagnetic Spectrum: Light Beyond Visible"
status: draft
content_verified: true
levels: [Both]
topics: [LightSpectra]
time_minutes: 10
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["wavelength", "frequency", "spectrum"]
learning_goals:
  - "Order EM bands by wavelength and frequency."
  - "Connect wavelength to what kinds of detectors/observations are needed."
  - "Explain why different bands reveal different physical processes."
misconceptions:
  - "All telescopes see the same thing; only magnification changes."
predict_prompt: "If you switch from visible to infrared observations, what kinds of objects or features might become easier to detect?"
play_steps:
  - "Compare bands and note the wavelength/frequency scale."
  - "Identify at least two real-world sources or uses for different bands."
  - "Match bands to a type of astronomical observation."
explain_prompt: "Explain how wavelength choice changes what information you can extract from an object."
model_notes:
  - 'Core relationships: $c=\lambda\nu$ and $E=h\nu=hc/\lambda$.'
  - 'Internal conversions use CGS constants: $c$ in $\mathrm{cm/s}$ and $h$ in $\mathrm{erg\,s}$.'
  - 'Readouts are reported in teaching-friendly units (nm/$\mu\mathrm{m}$/mm/m for $\lambda$; Hz for $\nu$; eV/keV/MeV for $E$).'

This demo helps you connect wavelength, frequency, and photon energy across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Use the slider (or band buttons) to explore orders of magnitude, then use the Convert panel to practice unit conversions.
