title: "Angular Size: The Sky’s Ruler"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [EarthSky]
time_minutes: 10
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["angles", "apparent size", "distance"]
learning_goals:
  - "Relate an object’s apparent size to its physical size and distance."
  - "Interpret small angles as a practical measurement tool in astronomy."
  - "Explain why nearby objects can look larger than distant ones."
misconceptions:
  - "If something looks bigger, it must be physically bigger."
predict_prompt: "If two objects have the same physical size, which looks bigger in the sky: the nearer one or the farther one?"
play_steps:
  - "Compare the apparent size of two objects at different distances."
  - "Hold distance fixed and change physical size; note what changes."
  - "Try to find two different (size, distance) pairs that look the same."
explain_prompt: "Use your observations to explain how apparent size depends on both size and distance."
model_notes:
  - "Angular diameter uses the exact geometric relation θ = 2 arctan(d / (2D))."
  - "Units: diameter d and distance D are always in km; angles are reported in degrees/arcminutes/arcseconds (°/′/″)."
  - "Moon time modes: (1) Orbit (perigee ↔ apogee) and (2) Recession (Myr from today; a toy linear extrapolation using a constant recession rate)."

This demo explores why objects can look big or small in the sky depending on both their physical size and their distance.

Use presets (astronomical + everyday) to build intuition, then use Station Mode to record (diameter, distance, angular size) cases you can compare and explain.
