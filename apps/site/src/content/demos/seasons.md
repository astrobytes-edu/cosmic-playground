title: "Seasons: Why Tilt Matters"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [EarthSky]
time_minutes: 12
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["tilt", "sunlight", "insolation"]
learning_goals:
  - "Explain why axial tilt causes seasons."
  - "Relate sun angle/day length to heating."
  - "Distinguish tilt-driven seasons from distance myths."
misconceptions:
  - "Seasons are caused by Earth being closer/farther from the Sun."
predict_prompt: "If Earth’s axis were not tilted, what would happen to seasons?"
play_steps:
  - "Compare tilt = 0° vs tilt = 23.5° and note what changes."
  - "Change date and observe day length changes between hemispheres."
  - "Relate sunlight angle to ‘how concentrated’ the energy is."
explain_prompt: "Use day length and sun angle to explain how tilt produces seasonal temperature changes."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
