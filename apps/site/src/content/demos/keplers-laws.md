title: "Kepler’s Laws: Patterns of Planetary Motion"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [Orbits]
time_minutes: 12
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["orbits", "period", "ellipses"]
learning_goals:
  - "Describe how orbital speed changes along an ellipse."
  - "Connect orbital period to distance from the central body."
  - "Use qualitative evidence to support a Kepler-law claim."
misconceptions:
  - "Planets move at the same speed all along their orbits."
predict_prompt: "Where in an elliptical orbit do you think a planet moves fastest: near perihelion or aphelion?"
play_steps:
  - "Adjust eccentricity and compare speed changes along the orbit."
  - "Compare two semi-major axes and observe how period changes."
  - "Look for a pattern you can summarize as a ‘law’."
explain_prompt: "Write a claim consistent with a Kepler law and back it with a specific observation from the demo."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
