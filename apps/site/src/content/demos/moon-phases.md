title: "Moon Phases: Light, Not Shadow"
status: beta
content_verified: true
levels: [Both]
topics: [EarthSky]
time_minutes: 8
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["phases", "illumination", "geometry"]
learning_goals:
  - "Explain why the Moon has phases using the Sun–Earth–Moon geometry."
  - "Connect phase angle to the fraction of the Moon that appears lit."
  - "Distinguish illuminated fraction from how much of the Moon you can see."
misconceptions:
  - "Phases are caused by Earth’s shadow."
predict_prompt: "If the Moon were always opposite the Sun in the sky, what phase would you always see?"
play_steps:
  - "Move the phase angle slider and describe what changes on the Moon’s face."
  - "Find the angle where the Moon looks half lit."
  - "Find the angles where the Moon looks fully dark and fully lit."
explain_prompt: "Use the idea of “illuminated fraction” to explain why the Moon looks different at different angles."
model_notes:
  - "This pilot visualization is a simplified 2D aid; it is not a full 3D rendering."
  - "Angle here is a proxy for Sun–Moon–Earth geometry; details will be refined in the full version."
