title: "Eclipse Geometry: Shadows in Space"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [EarthSky]
time_minutes: 12
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["eclipses", "shadows", "alignment"]
learning_goals:
  - "Explain eclipses using alignment and shadow geometry."
  - "Distinguish umbra vs penumbra in a qualitative way."
  - "Explain why eclipses do not occur every month."
misconceptions:
  - "Eclipses happen every time there’s a new or full Moon."
predict_prompt: "If the Moon orbits Earth once per month, why don’t we have eclipses every month?"
play_steps:
  - "Explore alignments and note when an eclipse is possible."
  - "Change the tilt/offset and see how eclipse likelihood changes."
  - "Compare solar vs lunar eclipse conditions."
explain_prompt: "Use alignment and orbital tilt to explain why eclipses are rare."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
