title: "Blackbody Radiation: Color and Temperature"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [LightSpectra]
time_minutes: 12
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["blackbody", "temperature", "spectrum"]
learning_goals:
  - "Relate temperature to the shape and peak of a thermal spectrum."
  - "Explain why hotter objects can appear ‘bluer’ and cooler ones ‘redder’."
  - "Distinguish spectrum shape from total brightness."
misconceptions:
  - "Red stars are hotter than blue stars."
predict_prompt: "If you heat an object up, does its peak emission shift toward redder or bluer wavelengths?"
play_steps:
  - "Increase temperature and watch the peak move."
  - "Compare two temperatures and describe differences in the curve shape."
  - "Relate the curve to a qualitative color impression."
explain_prompt: "Use peak shift and curve shape to explain how temperature changes observed color."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
