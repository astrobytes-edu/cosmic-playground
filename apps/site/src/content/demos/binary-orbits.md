levels: [Both]
topics: [Orbits]
time_minutes: 12
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["binaries", "center of mass", "gravity"]
learning_goals:
  - "Describe how two masses orbit a shared center of mass."
  - "Predict how changing mass ratio affects orbital motion."
  - "Connect orbital behavior to the idea of gravitational interaction."
misconceptions:
  - "The larger object stays fixed while the smaller one orbits it."
predict_prompt: "If one star is much more massive than the other, where is the center of mass located?"
play_steps:
  - "Adjust mass ratio and observe how the orbit changes."
  - "Compare cases where masses are equal vs very unequal."
  - "Identify which quantities appear to remain consistent."
station_params:
  - parameter: "Mass ratio (m₂/m₁)"
    value: "________"
    notice: "Heavier body moves less; barycenter shifts toward the heavier mass."
  - parameter: "Separation (a)"
    value: "________"
    notice: "Period changes quickly with distance (in this simplified circular model)."
explain_prompt: "Explain how the center of mass helps you understand the motion of both bodies."
model_notes:
  - "This pilot assumes perfectly circular orbits and point masses (no eccentricity, tides, or relativity)."
  - "Units are model units with G = 1; period and distances are not calibrated to real systems."

This pilot demo visualizes two masses orbiting a shared barycenter. It emphasizes *qualitative* relationships (how the barycenter shifts and how the period changes with separation) rather than modeling a specific astrophysical binary.
