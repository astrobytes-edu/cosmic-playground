title: "Binary Orbits: Two-Body Dance"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [Orbits]
time_minutes: 12
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["binaries", "center of mass", "gravity"]
learning_goals:
  - "Describe how two masses orbit a shared center of mass."
  - "Predict how changing mass ratio affects orbital motion."
  - "Connect orbital behavior to the idea of gravitational interaction."
misconceptions:
  - "The larger object stays fixed while the smaller one orbits it."
predict_prompt: "If one star is much more massive than the other, where is the center of mass located?"
play_steps:
  - "Adjust mass ratio and observe how the orbit changes."
  - "Compare cases where masses are equal vs very unequal."
  - "Identify which quantities appear to remain consistent."
explain_prompt: "Explain how the center of mass helps you understand the motion of both bodies."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
