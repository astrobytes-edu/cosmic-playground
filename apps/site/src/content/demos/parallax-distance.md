title: "Parallax Distance: Measuring the Stars"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [DataInference]
time_minutes: 12
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["parallax", "triangles", "distance"]
learning_goals:
  - "Explain parallax as apparent shift from two viewpoints."
  - "Connect smaller parallax angles to larger distances."
  - "Describe why measurement uncertainty matters for small angles."
misconceptions:
  - "Parallax is about an object moving, not the observer changing viewpoint."
predict_prompt: "If a star is twice as far away, what happens to its parallax angle (bigger or smaller)?"
play_steps:
  - "Change distance and observe the parallax shift."
  - "Identify what counts as the ‘baseline’ in the model."
  - "Test how small angles become hard to measure."
explain_prompt: "Use the triangle idea to explain why parallax decreases with distance."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
