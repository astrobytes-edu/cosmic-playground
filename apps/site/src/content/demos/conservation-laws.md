title: "Conservation Laws: Energy & Momentum"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [Orbits]
time_minutes: 10
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["energy", "momentum", "invariants"]
learning_goals:
  - "Identify quantities that remain constant under specific assumptions."
  - "Use conservation ideas to predict qualitative outcomes."
  - "Connect ‘conserved’ to ‘closed system’ and stated assumptions."
misconceptions:
  - "Energy is always conserved in the same form without exceptions."
predict_prompt: "In an ideal closed system with no external forces, what happens to total momentum over time?"
play_steps:
  - "Change a parameter and predict how it affects the outcome."
  - "Look for a quantity that appears unchanged across different settings."
  - "Write down the assumption(s) needed for the invariant to hold."
explain_prompt: "State what appears conserved in the model, and what assumptions make that conservation reasonable."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
