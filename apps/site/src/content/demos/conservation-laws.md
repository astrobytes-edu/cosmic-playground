  - "Identify quantities that remain constant under specific assumptions."
  - "Use conservation ideas to predict qualitative outcomes."
  - "Connect ‘conserved’ to ‘closed system’ and stated assumptions."
misconceptions:
  - "Energy is always conserved in the same form without exceptions."

  - "Change a parameter and predict how it affects the outcome."
  - "Look for a quantity that appears unchanged across different settings."
  - "Write down the assumption(s) needed for the invariant to hold."
explain_prompt: "State what appears conserved in the model, and what assumptions make that conservation reasonable."

Start with a circular case ($v/v_{\\rm circ}=1$), then move toward escape ($\\sqrt{2}$) and beyond to see how $\\varepsilon$ changes sign.
