title: "Telescope Resolution: Sharper Eyes"
status: draft
levels: [Both]
topics: [Telescopes]
time_minutes: 10
has_math_mode: false
tags: ["resolution", "aperture", "diffraction"]
learning_goals:
  - "Distinguish magnification from resolution."
  - "Explain how aperture affects the ability to separate close objects."
  - "Connect resolution limits to diffraction qualitatively."
misconceptions:
  - "More magnification always shows more detail."
predict_prompt: "If you keep magnification fixed but increase aperture, what changes: brightness, resolution, or both?"
play_steps:
  - "Compare two apertures and note what details become distinguishable."
  - "Try to separate a close pair; record the threshold where it becomes possible."
  - "Compare the effect of changing magnification vs changing aperture."
explain_prompt: "Explain why resolution is limited and why aperture matters for detail."
model_notes:
  - "This is currently a stub while the legacy demo is migrated into the new runtime."

This demo will be migrated into the Cosmic Playground runtime; for now it provides a placeholder `/play/` target.
