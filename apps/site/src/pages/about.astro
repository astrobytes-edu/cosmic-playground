    <h2>What is Cosmic Playground?</h2>
    <div class="cp-prose">
      <p>
        Cosmic Playground is a suite of <strong>14 interactive astronomy demos</strong>
        covering topics from moon phases and retrograde motion to equations of state and
        Kepler's laws. Each demo is a self-contained browser instrument — no login, no
        installation, no plugins. The entire site is a static "interactive museum" that
        runs on any device with a modern browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every demo ships with a <strong>Station Mode</strong> for structured data collection,
        a <strong>Challenge Mode</strong> for formative self-assessment, and an
        <strong>Export</strong> button for copying data tables into lab documents. The goal
        is not just visualization but <em>scaffolded inquiry</em>: students collect data,
        identify patterns, and make evidence-based claims.

  <section class="about-section" aria-label="The Predict-Play-Explain Framework">
    <h2>The Predict–Play–Explain Framework</h2>
    <div class="cp-prose">
      <p>
        Our pedagogical scaffold adapts the classic <strong>Predict–Observe–Explain</strong>
        (POE) framework of White &amp; Gunstone (1992), with one key modification: we replace
        passive "Observe" with active <strong>"Play."</strong> Students don't just watch a
        simulation — they manipulate parameters, collect data, and test their own predictions.
      </p>
      <ul class="cadence-pills" aria-label="Three phases">
        <li><strong>Predict</strong> — Before touching the demo, write a one-sentence prediction. Committing to a prediction activates prior knowledge and creates a "need to know."</li>
        <li><strong>Play</strong> — Interact with the demo: drag sliders, change parameters, record data in Station Mode. Active manipulation replaces passive observation.</li>
        <li><strong>Explain</strong> — After collecting evidence, write a claim supported by at least one number and one sanity check. The artifact is the student's own data table and reasoning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This three-phase cycle runs in 6–12 minutes per station, making it suitable for
        lecture warm-ups, lab activities, and multi-station rotations.

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
    <div class="cp-prose">
      <dl class="principles">
        <dt>Cognitive Load Theory</dt>
        <dd>
          Following Sweller (1988), each demo minimizes extraneous load by presenting
          one governing relationship at a time. Controls are limited to the essential
          parameters; advanced options are hidden behind progressive disclosure.
        </dd>
        <dt>Multimedia Learning</dt>
        <dd>
          Consistent with Mayer (2001), text and visuals are spatially and temporally
          integrated. Readouts update in real time next to the visual they describe.
          Decorative elements are minimized — every visual element encodes data.
        </dd>
        <dt>PhET-Inspired Interactivity</dt>
        <dd>
          Inspired by the PhET Interactive Simulations project (Wieman et al., 2008),
          demos are designed for <em>productive exploration</em>: students can discover
          relationships by dragging sliders, not by reading instructions. Immediate,
          continuous feedback makes cause-and-effect relationships visible.
        </dd>
        <dt>Station Mode as Scaffolded Data Collection</dt>
        <dd>
          Every demo includes a Station Mode that converts free exploration into
          structured data collection. Students add rows to a live table, then export the
          data for use in lab reports. This bridges the gap between "playing with a toy"
          and "doing science."

    <h2>Evidence Base</h2>
    <div class="cp-prose">
      <p>
        The design of Cosmic Playground is informed by decades of physics and
        astronomy education research:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Freeman et al. (2014)</strong> — A meta-analysis of 225 studies in
          <em>PNAS</em> found that active learning reduces failure rates by 1.5&times; and
          increases exam scores by 0.47 standard deviations compared to traditional
          lecturing. Interactive simulations with structured inquiry are a core active
          learning strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mazur (1997)</strong> — <em>Peer Instruction</em> demonstrated that
          conceptual understanding improves when students commit to predictions before
          receiving feedback — the foundation of our Predict phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bardar et al. (2007)</strong> — The Lunar Phases Concept Inventory
          (LPCI) showed that targeted interactive instruction produces statistically
          significant gains in understanding of moon phases, one of the most persistent
          misconceptions in astronomy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Zeilik et al. (1997)</strong> — The Test of Astronomy Standards
          (TOAST) provides a validated instrument for measuring conceptual gains in
          introductory astronomy, against which Predict–Play–Explain activities can be
          benchmarked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>White &amp; Gunstone (1992)</strong> — The original Predict–Observe–Explain
          framework, which we adapt by replacing passive observation with active
          parameter manipulation and data collection.

          for a clean PDF with answer blanks and data tables.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Playlists</strong> bundle 3–5 demos into themed sequences with

        <li>
          All demos are <strong>free, open-source, and static</strong> — no accounts,
          no server, no IT requests. Host on your own domain or link directly to ours.
